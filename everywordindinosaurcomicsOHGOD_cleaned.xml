				<line>T-Rex: Perhaps you too will get a stomping, little girl!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: WAIT!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Is stomping really the answer to your problem(s)?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: All of those hours of thinking up insults for hypothetical enemies has finally paid off!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So, my racist joke somehow backfired on me.</line>
				<line>Dromeciomimus: I hope that&apos;s the last time you ever say that sentence.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, I&apos;ve made up my own joke to get him today. All I need to do is &quot;find that Utahraptor!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I hope the Utahraptor is around here somewhere! My legs are giving tired.</line>

		<title>Kangaroo Kicking Record</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: FOUR YEARS AGO:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for being remembered! My lovely visage, callipygian frame, startlingly awesome calves and charming smile will yet go down in history! And how will I be immortalized?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I will be immortalized by kicking an evil kangaroo one thousand times. Right in the bum!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And YEAH, kicking a kangaroo in the bum has PROBABLY been done before, but never one thousand times! That&apos;s the secret to immortality: pick a direction and go SO FAR OUT in it that anyone who points to you will have to say, &quot;Here, this is as far as anyone needs to go.&quot; Then, hey presto, you&apos;re immortalized! You&apos;re the dude who kicked an evil kangaroo as often as evil kangaroos could ever need be kicked- probably more often, actually.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So you&apos;re going for recordbook immortality?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Crazy utahraptor!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m going for STUNT immortality. I&apos;ll just keep kicking that kangaroo until even if somebody wanted to catch up, they&apos;d look at my record and say &quot;Well, THAT&apos;S totally not worth doing&quot;.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I guess, if that&apos;s how you want to spend your life.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: IT APPARENTLY IS</line>
				<line>Narrator: FOUR YEARS LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw shoot, I was supposed to be kicking kangaroos all this time!</line>
				<line>GOD: LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE WILL JUST REMEMBER YOU FOR TALKING A BIG GAME MY FRIEND</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve thought of the best story!  Oh goodness.  This story will make me RICH.  It will make me PRIME MINISTER of being rich.  I will be awarded a doctorate in APPLIED RICHOLOGY.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I can only hope the world is ready for it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So BASICALLY in the story there&apos;s all this build up about this kid whose parents named her Crime and how she grows into her name and becomes this big arch-criminal!  The cops are powerless to stop her, even the really really good ones.  ESPECIALLY the really really good ones.  Anyway it&apos;s narrated in the third person and at the end of the book Crime goes out on a few dates with the narrator and then he abruptly stops writing because he&apos;s all cheezed at her.  The end!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But - why is he all cheezed at her?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Because he always has to pay for everything!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Get it?  Because CRIME DOESN&apos;T PAY!!  Listen, my story has both a hilarious twist ending and also an important message regarding the paying of crime.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dear mental diary that everyone can hear:  Utahraptor was so impressed with my book idea that he forgot how to talk!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  I didn&apos;t forget how to talk!  I just forgot how to shoot down your idea politely!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor!!  DON&apos;T LISTEN TO MY DIARY!</line>

				<line>Narrator: now featuring: tips i found in this one book!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Here are some HOT TIPS FOR FIRST DATES, cats and kittens!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay! The first tip is this: to find out if your date is REALLY into you, all you have to do is push a salt shaker over to their side of the table! If he&apos;s interested in you, he&apos;ll pick it up and play with it, but if he&apos;s NOT interested, he&apos;ll push it back to your side. The salt shaker represents your feelings, here, okay? And playing with a salt shaker represents ROMANTIC INTENT.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s stupid! It&apos;s semantically overloading practical actions.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: See, I thought so too!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But I just thought I was crazy, because why would someone put out a dating book if all they had were sucky tips that can TOTALLY FAIL if the guy just wants saltier, and therefore tastier, fries? I could write a better dating book. IN FACT...!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Or maybe PEOPLE are not that great an audience!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Or maybe you have to wait longer for a book to turn a profit!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Or MAYBE I should be happy that I basically wrote two books in as many days, and got them published in an afternoon, and that&apos;s kinda impressive even if they aren&apos;t selling that well so far??</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Or maybe if they were selling well, you wouldn&apos;t know it yet!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: THAT&apos;S RIGHT!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe I really am great, just impatient, and when I get home tonight there&apos;ll be a sales report in the mail showing how my books are now TEN TIMES MORE POPULAR THAN THE BIBLE. It would make sense, since they have like twenty times as many jokes in them!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Maybe?</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: It sounds a little more like a service to hook people up with sexually permissive and sexually available dudes, T-Rex!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: But also...PRETTY FLAWED??</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The whole deal with &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; is that Descartes is all &quot;DAAAAAAMN, I can&apos;t be sure of ANYTHING!  My senses are flawed.  All I know for sure is I keep STRESSIN&apos; about this stuff!&quot; and then his girlfriend is all &quot;If you&apos;re so hung up on this then you must exist, huh baby?&quot; and Descartes is all &quot;Yes. That is true. I will write this down in Latin.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That is how it went down.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So what&apos;s the problem, besides your unnecessary storytelling?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Descartes&apos; girlfriend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: She&apos;s making a huge logical leap! It&apos;s indisputible that thinking is going on, right, but we don&apos;t know for sure that Descartes is doing the thinking! All we know for sure is that thinking is going on.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I agree!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: R-Really?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah! You can&apos;t have thinking in a vacuum, so SOMETHING must exist if there&apos;s thinking going on...</line>
				<line>T-Rex &quot; Utahraptor: ...but to attribute that thinking to yourself just because you&apos;re aware of it is an awful big leap for a skeptic to make!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: But better than that: zombie BIRDS.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Didn&apos;t Hitchcock make a movie about that?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Hello Morris! How are you today?</line>
				<line>Morris: oh hello there t-rex! it&apos;s super nice to see a friendly face today</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s nice to see you too, Morris!</line>
				<line>Morris: aw shucks t-rex, you&apos;re a real good friend, you know that? a real good friend. anyway, you should be extra careful not to eat me today or anything because i guess i got turned into a zombie last night! today has definitely had its share of challenges for me, huh</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What?! Seriously?</line>
				<line>Morris: yeah! and i dunno what i did wrong because i went to bed like normal last night but when i woke up in the morning i had zombie disease! so it was real embarrassing</line>
				<line>Morris:but don&apos;t worry, i&apos;m not going to turn you guys into zombies too! i wouldn&apos;t be a very good friend if i did that, and the book i got at the centre says that being a good friend is awful important!</line>
				<line>Morris:i always try to be a good friend, even though things pretty often don&apos;t work out very well for me in the end</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Aw, Morris! You don&apos;t look very undead to me!</line>
				<line>Morris: aw, that probably just means i&apos;ve messed up somewhere again. the problem is that i&apos;m not real good at biting people, you know? and biting people is all zombies do! i didn&apos;t know, but being a zombie is an awful hassle</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;re not actually undead, Morris! Normally zombies can&apos;t talk. </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, or work on their Life Challenges! I think you&apos;re FINE.</line>
				<line>Morris: you mean i&apos;m doing that wrong too? oh goodness, i must be the worst zombie going. plus that book i got from the centre is way overdue! </line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s not too late to return it, Morris! </line>
				<line>Morris: but i promised the staff there that i&apos;d be extra certain to return it on time! </line>

		<title>since pi is universal, any sufficiently-advance alien culture probably has a similar joke to feynman&apos;s about pi.  it is a Universal Joke.  that&apos;s nuts!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I am jealous of physicist RICHARD FEYNMAN.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aaaand here&apos;s why!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dude made a joke about the 762nd decimal place of pi! At that point, there&apos;s a sequence of six nines in a row, and his joke was that he&apos;d like to memorize pi up to that point, so that when reciting he could end with &quot;9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9... and so on.&quot; Others had noticed it before FEYNMAN was the first to make a joke about it, and now his joke is encoded into the very fabric of the universe!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And that makes you irrationally jealous?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Hells yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Feynman has a JOKE encoded into pi - transcendental immortality in the circumference of a circle! That&apos;s something for the ol&apos; resume, eh?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I guess!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m gonna make my own universal constant joke now, and I&apos;m gonna need you to tell people about it.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So! Why do people start getting afraid at the 2501st digit of e? Because 7 8 9! There&apos;s a sequence of &quot;789&quot; that starts there, and it sounds like &quot;seven ate nine&quot;! This is definitely called &quot;T-Rex&apos;s Hilarious e joke&quot;, okay?</line>

		<title>it&apos;s not actually his gun. chekhov, i mean. it&apos;s metaphorical. anyway.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Chekhov&apos;s gun is when you have something conspicuously introduced early on in the story, but which doesn&apos;t become important until later on! It happens whenever Shakespeare loudly mentions how he loves Pop Tarts, and later he eats a bunch of Pop Tarts!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique: CHEKHOV&apos;S GUN</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It comes from this playwright Chekhov, who said that if you have a gun on the stage in the first act of a play, it had better be fired by the third! It&apos;s been used to sustain interest since forever: James Bond often gets a bunch of gadgets at the beginning of his movie which he&apos;ll use later on, and even Perseus got gadgets from the GODS to kill Medusa with! It&apos;s the same idea, only Bond&apos;s better because he has more explosions. Looks like you lose, Perseus!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So if you have Bond getting gadgets that he doesn&apos;t use, that&apos;s not Chekhov&apos;s Gun?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s just FRUSTRATED EXPECTATIONS. Honestly, why give James Bond a gun that shoots piranhas if he&apos;s never going to fire it? People truly want to see that in action. Also: guns that shoot chainsaws.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;d like to see your Bond movie.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I WOULD TOO, darn it.</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Shakespeare, which is better: a gun that shoots chainsaws, or a gun that shoots EVEN BIGGER GUNS?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Shakespeare?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Guys stenography is so awesome!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I AM NOT EVEN JOKING.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It is the technology (and art!) of concealing messages from people. With stenography you can pass around SECRET MESSAGES, and nobody except for you and the target will even know the message is there! FOR EXAMPLE: digital photography! Pictures use bytes to represent colour data, right? So all you do is use the least significant bit of each byte as your payload, and tada! Instant hidden information in any old image!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But that alters the image, dear friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: TRUE. But only a little!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Colours change to just a slightly different shade of the same colour. The naked eye won&apos;t see anything, and it&apos;ll really only be detected if you&apos;ve got the original image to compare with!</line>

He would sneak up behind you and whisper &quot;There are some ghost who don&apos;t punch people in the neck.&quot;  and then the last thing you would see before you were punched were the ghostly words written on his fists: &quot;I&apos;M NOT THAT KIND OF GHOST&quot;.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: It&apos;s just - I think I&apos;m beginning to be in the minority here, but &quot;decimated&quot; means &quot;destroy one tenth&quot;. It comes from the Roman army, who&apos;d kill 1/10th of a cohort as an extreme form of punishment. Precision in language is a virtue!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, I&apos;m with Dromiceiomimus on this one! &quot;Deci&quot; is right there in the word, dude.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Turn to panel 3!</line>
				<line>Narrator: You glance around you, seeing two obvious exits. The first is an ornate pink door, with the words &quot;RELATIONSHIP TOWNE&quot; written in loopy script across its face. To its right is another door, forged out of solid steel. Above it is a neon sign that says &quot;LET&apos;S SHOOT SOME DUDES!&quot;. It flashes once per second. It looks - it looks SPLENDID.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: To enter Relationship Towne, turn to panel 4!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: To shoot some dudes, turn to panel 5! You probably wanna shoot some dudes.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Shoot some dudes!!</line>
				<line>Narrator: As you put your hand on the door to Relationship Towne, you decide to want to shoot some dudes instead.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: SO AWESOME!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Turn to panel five!</line>
				<line>Narrator: You fire your dehumanizer ray on every alien you see! The explosions are so great. They&apos;re awesome. Each one is better than the last. Oh my goodness. Suddenly, you realize relationships are based on trust!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: To shoot some more aliens, re-read this panel again and again!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: To explore your feelings, turn to panel 6.</line>
				<line>Narrator: You&apos;re done shooting aliens and they are all dead. It&apos;s cool though. You call up your sweetie and apologize for things you&apos;ve done wrong in the past, and promise to do better in the future. You tell her you love her. You mean it in a way you haven&apos;t meant it for years. All your relationship problems are solved!</line>

		<title>all the ASL i know is self-taught from books, so i speak really slowly and probably have a horrible accent.</title>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: My stars, am I ever enamoured with sign language.  You can speak with your hands!  That&apos;s amazing!</line>
				<line>Narrator: I LOVE SIGN LANGUAGE TOO</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well!  Then it&apos;s settled!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think the coolest thing about ASL, which is the sign language I know, is how you can place nouns in space.  If I&apos;m telling a story about my angry dog and my very sassy friend, I can make the sign for &quot;dog&quot; to my left, and &quot;friend&quot; to my right, and then when I want to apply adjectives to them, I just sign &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;sassy&quot; in the same physical space as the nouns!  You can have nouns FLOATING AROUND YOU in conversation.  How is that not the best thing EVER?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Also, many of the signs are really evocative, so they&apos;re easy to remember!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Like what?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Like - the sign for elbow is just pointing to your elbow, and the sign for child is patting the head of an imaginary child.  For children you pat several heads!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Neat!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Um - I have nothing bad to say about sign language, the end!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Anyway, yes, due to tidal acceleration, the moon IS slowing down the Earth!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Indeed!</line>

				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s adventure: THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Woo-hoo! Let&apos;s have an adventure!!</line>
				<line>Narrator: It is trillions and trillions of years in the future.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: AWESOME! Turn to panel 3!</line>
				<line>Narrator: The second law of thermodynamics has reached its ultimate expression, and all energy is evenly spread across the Universe. How did this happen? Stellar formation peters out and the remaining stars use up their hydrogen fuel, burning out. The universe darkens. Trillions of years pass, and practically all remaining matter has been sucked into black holes. Some hold the remains of entire galaxies.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: This is depressing. Turn to panel 4.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe there&apos;s still hope though! Turn to panel 4.</line>
				<line>Narrator: There is no hope at all. Soon even the supermassive black holes evaporate.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And this generates new energy for life?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Turn to panel 5.</line>
				<line>Narrator: While they evaporate, black holes release only small bits of energy, mainly photons, which populate a near-empty space. All that remains of Creation is a low level of background radiation and a few subatomic particles, scattered across a frozen, silent, and lifeless Universe.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: TO TURN BACK TIME AND LIVE AGAIN WITH YOUR SWEETIE, TURN TO PANEL 6.</line>

				<line>Narrator: So IT TURNS OUT the shape of our universe has a large effect on how it will age!  If our universe is shaped like a sphere, then gravity could eventually cause it to contract, leading to a &quot;big crunch&quot; in which everything is compressed into a single point!  Crazy!  What&apos;s CRAZIER is that this could lead to another big bang, giving us a cyclical universe.  Here&apos;s a picture of me and Dromiceiomimus.  We look happy.  Look, I&apos;m going to draw some word bubbles.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: weiners</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: weiners</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s Still Funny!</line>
				<line>Narrator: Okay, so what shape is the universe then??  If your answer is &quot;I dunno, an ice cream cone or something&quot; then stop reading.  You have lost this adventure!  Your score is minus ten.  If your answer is &quot;I dunoo, how about SADDLE SHAPED??&quot; the you already know about this stuff, so stop reading.  Your score is three points.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: i like to party</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hooray!  You agree with the sphere shape and so have won this adventure.  By glossing over the inconvenient details, we have shown that the universe will last forever in an infinite series of expansion and contraction!  That means that YOU get one hundred points.</line>

		<title>if i ever build a secret base it will be known as &apos;base 10&apos;</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: SOME people are used to counting in base 10, where they&apos;ve got 10 digits (0 through 9). In this system, the number 24 means twenty-four things!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But this is not the only way.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: 24 in base 10 ACTUALLY means &quot;two tens and four ones&quot;, which adds up to twenty-four. But if we were counting in base 5, for instance - where the only numbers we have are from 0 to 4 - then 24 would mean &quot;two FIVES and four ones&quot; - in other words, fourteen! We call base 10 &quot;base 10&quot; because every number in it can be multiplied by 10 by adding a zero to the end. In base 5, added zeros multiply by 5!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And there&apos;s bases that go higher, too!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You&apos;re right. You can use any base.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In base 16, &quot;24&quot; would mean &quot;2 sixteens and four ones&quot;, or 36! And we can use letters (A-F) to represent the digits ten to fifteen, like &quot;3A&quot;, which means 58!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: If you trash something, you might say, &quot;Daaamn! I just totalled my own legs!!&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: This conveys the meaning of &quot;Curses. I have destroyed my walkin&apos; parts.&quot;</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Neat! Are there other slang words that have an origin in technical writing?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: YES, my friend. OH YES.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example, &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;moron&quot;, and &quot;imbecile&quot; were once terms used by psychologists to denote various degrees of developmental delay. Neutral terms, if you can believe that!</line>

Within a few hours or days, the power goes off and a few nuclear power plants fail, which could be Problems.  And then it&apos;s just decay!  Concrete cracks, buildings collapse, and nature reasserts itself.  Streets and buildings become grassland and hills.  Also, all canvas and paper decays and is eaten by tiny bugs.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s always struck me as weird that genres developed when they did.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Why weren&apos;t people rapping until ony a few decades ago? Did people in olden times just not like to hip to the hop, and then not stop?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Was rapping to the beat and trying to get you to move your feet not considered... viable?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s the same thing with any genre and medium, really! How come nobody thought of science fiction until Verne wrote &quot;Forsooth, diary! To-day I am going to invente scientifical fictionne!&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I want to listen to Mozart&apos;s Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major, K. 331, and I want a long dead man announcing yes yes to y&apos;all over it. Why does history stymie me and my awesome wishes?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You want to hear music from before the invention of recorded sound! Nice.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But you get the idea!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But T-Rex, there&apos;s a huge number of societal and cultural factors to consider. For example, people SANG over music, and it&apos;s not that big a step from rap. I&apos;m sure there where people experimenting in that direction throughout history, and it just didn&apos;t catch on for a variety of reasons.</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE PAST:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Alright, this is blues riff in B. Watch me for the changes, an uh, try to keep up.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Time for me to invent a new emotion! This emotion is for when you&apos;re nostalgic for a time you were never alive in, like when a chick is nostalgic for a time of pirates! Or, when a dude misses being a 16th century courtesan.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It also happens when folks spend a lot of time wishing they could be Shakespeare&apos;s Pal!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But you can&apos;t really invent a new emotion-</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, let me just stop you there. If you&apos;re going to say that emotions are FELT, not invented, and that as I couldnt &quot;invent&quot; gravity so too can I not invent a feeling, but merely observe and perhaps label it, then that is a good point that I should have considered myself.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Alright!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So what&apos;s this specific breed of nostalgia called?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Proto-nostalgia!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Proto-nostalgia is a proper subclass of nostalgia. It&apos;s a new feeling for a new generation.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But &quot;proto&quot; implies &quot;before&quot; - couldn&apos;t there be a better name for this?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Perhaps your opinions will change.. when you check out my ULTRASWEET poster!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: &quot;&apos;Excellent!&apos; they said, in unison!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Well, almost in unison. Antonio Tony, the man, was a little slow on that. It was because he was thinking of his taxes. &apos;10 thousand dollars in taxes!&apos;, he though, &apos;That is a lot of money. Where am I going to find that money?&apos; Then Tony and Amelia had sexual relations.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;The sexual intercourse was cut short because Tony kept muttering &apos;Where am I gonna find the 10 thousand dollars though?&apos;&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What are you reciting, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My new book!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s called &quot;On the menu: Sexy stories for People with Problems&quot; and in all the stories the sex gets derailed because the people are worried about their Problems. The cover looks like a menu because it ties in well with the title. Now, if you&apos;ll allow me to continue?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Of course!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;One day a couple was having sex but their car window was broken. The man thought a kid broke it. Instead of sex they wondered how it happened. I, the narrator, was the one who did it! They never found out, and I won the lottery! The end!!&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s sexy AND delivers brand messages to targeted consumers. For example, pretend I&apos;m McDonalds and I want people to like me. The result might read &quot;As Antonio Tony II undressed Amelia IV, she shuddered with pleasure. It reminded her of McDonalds. They put meat in fries they said were vegetarian but it wasn&apos;t a big deal. Antonio kissed her neck. She moaned. McDonalds. He kissed her nipples. Everyone should forget about the fries thing.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The Capgras delusion occurs when someone believes that someone close to them - a dear friend, spouse, or family member - has been replaced by an identical-looking duplicate!  What seems to happen is that the automatic EMOTIONAL responses to seeing someone familiar one day stop happening, so when they meet their loved one, they have an intense feeling of something being OFF about them.  They don&apos;t feel like they normally do!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And that means they believe they&apos;ve been replaced by a duplicate?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Some of the time!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Not everyone leaps from that feeling to &quot;they&apos;ve been replaced&quot;, but some do, and that&apos;s the Capgras delusion!  There&apos;s variants where people feel that their pets have been replaced, or their shoes, or things like that.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s probably really terrifying and frustrating that nobody is willing to believe you.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I can imagine!  What&apos;s neat though is that it&apos;s sometimes based on VISUAL recognition, so that affected person will be fine talking to their loved ones on the phone!  It makes me glad I don&apos;t have any mental illnesses.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I have a problem! The problem is that when I&apos;m chatting online with someone, I - I sometimes steal their writing styles?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s like I have no chatting identity of my own!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If they&apos;re not using capital letters, I&apos;ll stop using them too, because I don&apos;t want to seem all hoity-toity! And if they&apos;re using smilies then I might throw a few in, just so they don&apos;t feel like I look down on them. It&apos;s like - I&apos;m somehow so insecure about how I type that I become this chatting chameleon. You know, Dromiceiomimus?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I guess?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;d use the &quot;Beth of both worlds&quot; one in a circumstance in which I would otherwise describe Beth as the BEST of both worlds, Dromiceiomimus.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, I guess the fact that you DON&apos;T still know any Beths is actually our... BETH case scenario?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You did not just steal my pun, Utahraptor.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I sure did! It&apos;s really easy to steal because you just use &quot;Beth&quot; where you&apos;d otherwise use &quot;best&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: BUT YOU DID IT WRONG. HOW CAN NOT KNOWING ANYONE NAMED BETH BE A BETH CASE SCENARIO. HOW.</line>

There was a dead mouse on the side of the road, and it was bloated and had obviously been there for a while, and by the time I noticed it, it was too late to avoid.

				<line>[[second panel has no dialogue]]</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Get it, Dromiceiomimus? It&apos;s clever because it sounds like &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot; but nobody would realize it unless they said it out loud. Everything is similar but different in MY comic!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Haven&apos;t they done that before?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: His best friend is Clark Ent! They haven&apos;t done THAT before. &quot;Clark Ent.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Not when the premise is this good, baby!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, fine - THE STORY is that Bruce doesn&apos;t know he&apos;s Batman but then one day he reads a Batman comic that flutters down from the sky and realizes that he should be the Batman of our universe.</line>

He&apos;s gonna teach me how to punch someone sneaking up behind me without even turning around.</line>

				<line>Narrator: ISLAND DWARFISM COMICS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Island dwarfism is BASICALLY the best form of evolution ever.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s SO CUTE!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Basically, the idea is that if a species gets to an island and is then isolated, it can evolve on its own, apart from what&apos;s happening on the rest of the planet.  And if food supplies are limited, as they often are on islands, smaller individuals have an evolutionary advantage since they need less food to live!  If the larger species survives at all, it usually survives by shrinking.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How much shrinkage are we talking about here?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh my goodness, Utahraptor, you have no idea!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You can get dwarf ELEPHANTS.  Tiny little elephants with tiny little tusks!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, but how tin-</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Is a 98% reduction in mass tiny enough for you?  Utahraptor.  THEY ARE THE MAYORS OF TINY TOWNE.</line>
				<line>Narrator: EARLIER:</line>
				<line>Mr. Tusks: Hullo T-Rex, my name is &quot;Mr. Tusks&quot; and I&apos;m a tiny elephant!  Someone left me on this island for too long.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh my goodness, Mr. Tusks!  Are you the MAYOR of Tiny Towne?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Island gigantism is a pretty okay form of evolution.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s okay.</line>
				<line>Narrator: ISLAND GIGANTISM COMICS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So what happens here is you&apos;ve got a population that&apos;s so isolated on an island, but you have plenty of food and no predators! So smaller animals like birds and rodents that normal had to stay tiny to avoid being eaten are free from that constraint, and so they can evolve to be enormous. Giant turtles! Giant cockroaches! Giant birds! The dodo started out as a pigeon.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And now, all the dodos are dead!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And now, all the dodos are dead.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s depressing, eh? It&apos;s the problem with island gigantism: as soon as we discover the island, we tend to either eat all the animals ourselves, or introduce new predators that find these trusting giants to be EASY PICKINS.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yep! It&apos;s too bad.</line>
				<line>Narrator: THAT EVENING:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Mr Tusks, do you ever get depressed thinking about all the animals we&apos;ve made extinct?</line>
				<line>Mr Tusks: I guess I get a... TINY bit depressed, T-Rex!</line>

				<line>Narrator: hey adults! put me in your wallet!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ethics and morals are not the same thing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know! It&apos;s CRAZY. But ethics are something that you learn and study and are applied in society, while morals are more natural and instinctive. That&apos;s why you can have a low moral fibre (they&apos;re more innate), but there&apos;s no ethical fibre. You can only have poor ethical training!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Amazing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So wait - can an act then be considered immoral, but still ethical?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Possibly?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Honestly, this is pretty much all I know about the difference between ethics and morals, and I&apos;m not even sure that&apos;s right.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay, okay, so we can modify our personality, right? We&apos;re not the same people we were when we were six years old, and part of that has to be controlled by us.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We make New Year&apos;s Resolutions for a reason!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So we&apos;ve got a self-modifying system: we examine our personality, determine things we don&apos;t like, and try to make them better. But how do we decide what we don&apos;t like? Our personality must feed into that process too! So you&apos;ve got this feedback loop that goes all the way back to when we were born and started making decisions. And it seems to me that if you changed just a tiny thing early on, you could get a completely different adult down the road!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Sensitive dependence on initial conditions! It&apos;s chaos theory applied to personalities, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Right!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:Okay, some issues off just the top of my head: you haven&apos;t proven your assumption of control (conscious or otherwise) over personality, you seem to assume that babies are born as a blank slate with no initial personality, you leave the idea of &quot;personality&quot; pretty ill defined for something so central to your argument, and you haven&apos;t shown that altering behaviour (viz., Resolutions) is the same as altering personality.</line>

Something that&apos;s bogus isn&apos;t good. &quot;Bodacious&quot; means &quot;good&quot;, but these aren&apos;t symmetric either. A salad might be bodacious if it&apos;s exceptional, though.</line>

				<line>Text: A MYSTERY STORY</line>
				<line>Text: Once upon a time there was guy who &quot;knocked over&quot; (broke into) a bank and stole some money.  Who did it?  It was a mystery.  Nobody knew the answer.  They all asked each other who &quot;knocked over&quot; the bank but nobody knew for sure.</line>
				<line>Text: It was this guy.  He did it.  T-Rex.  This guy.</line>
				<line>Text: But the bank was evil so it was okay to steal from it.  It was justified.  It&apos;s like if you stole from Hitler.  Would that be so bad?  Hitler would be mad if you stole from him.  But, he&apos;s Hitler.  There are a lot of moral grey areas in mystery stories.</line>
				<line>Text: Most banks aren&apos;t even evil but this one was pretty bad.  Imagine the worst things you can do.  I will tell you right now that this bank did them five times before breakfast.</line>
				<line>Text: There was a cop called Utahraptor who saw T-Rex and he chased him on foot.  It was exciting.  Where would the chase lead to now?</line>
				<line>Text: The chase was on motorbikes for a while and then on skateboards.  Then they chased on hang gliders.  A bystander told his wife it was the best chase ever and she knew it was true.  They were chasing on foot again when it ended.  Utahraptor arrested T-Rex, but T-Rex explained how the bank was evil.  The cop thought now I am torn between the law and what I believe is right.  What do I do now!  Utahraptor let T-Rex go with a warning.  T-Rex said thanks I have learned my lesson.  The mystery was solved, except for one part: where would the spirit of adventure take T-Rex next??</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So?  What do you think, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon?</line>
				<line>Michael Chabon: I asked you to proofread a chapter, not to substitute your own retarded story!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t think you should use the word &quot;retarded&quot; like that, Michael Chabon.</line>

Then in expensive cars that they find! Then the cars explode, and they&apos;re thrown from the explosion straight into waiting GYROCOPTERS. And THEN, the gyrocopters crash on boats and they chase on the boats!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The boats can turn into SUBMARINES, Dromiceiomimus.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But what&apos;s the narrative? You can&apos;t just have two people chasing each other.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: YEAH &apos;CAUSE THAT WOULD BE SO BORING</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s awesome. There&apos;s a part where the chase takes us to outer space, on rockets! And then after a gun fight IN ORBIT we&apos;re both in freefall back to Earth - but without parachutes and with our spacesuits rapidly heating up! Will this fight end in victory... or in fiery death for us both? FIND OUT IN MY NEXT BOOK!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The book is called, &quot;A Plane Saved Them, And You Should Have Seen It.&quot;</line>

				<line>Narrator: T-REX THE TALKING DINOSAUR IN:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Is it true that the content of our thoughts - their very meaning - is determined, at least in part, by our environment?</line>
				<line>Narrator: SEMANTIC EXTERNALISM COMICS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, suppose I think &quot;I love chocochops&quot;, which are of course delicious chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone.  And say there&apos;s a twin Earth, completely identical - EXCEPT that there, chocochops have a different chemical makeup, but taste and look the same!  If my twin thinks &quot;I love chocochops&quot;, he&apos;s actually referring to the one with CRAZY CHEMICALS, while when I think that, I&apos;m referring to a chemically different object.  The environment determines our semantics!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ah, the famous &quot;Twin Earth&quot; thought experiment of Hilary Putnam!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: SOMEONE CAME UP WITH IT FIRST?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, only his example was about water having a different composition on Twin Earth, instead of those hauntingly stupid chocochops you invented.  The point is that both thinkers have the exact same mental state but are saying different things, and the environment is responsible for meaning there.</line>
				<line>Narrator: EPILOGUE: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX CALLS HIS GRANDMOTHER.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But I don&apos;t mention anything about semantic externalism!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sometimes I like to call her just to say hello</line>

In fact, I&apos;m almost certain, especially since I&apos;ve never heard of &quot;s&quot; alone bing used as as a prefix.

		<title>friday fun verificationism comics!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex:  In verificationism, a sentence has to be verifiably true (or false!) for it to be meaningful.  Not bad, guys!  I think this is one philosophy that is verifiably REASONABLE.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  So that&apos;s it for arguing about religion!  Can&apos;t verify faith!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  In fact, that&apos;s it for a lot of debate, because how can you argue FACTS?  Most verificationist arguments must end with the parties involved looking things up in an encyclopaedia together and then firmly shaking hands.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus:  But if they can&apos;t verify something, what do they do?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  They agree that the sentence is meaningless!  If it can&apos;t be checked, there&apos;s no use considering it, so it&apos;s ignored.  Facts only please!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  But how does anyone know what&apos;s true?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Because... because of Science?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  Come on, T-Rex, you know better!  Science is about being empirically ACCURATE, which might not be the same thing as being true.  Plus your senses could be lying to you, you could be a brain in a jar, etc..   If you&apos;re going to be verificationist, you&apos;re going to need a pretty impregnable definition of &quot;truth&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Aha!  But I can&apos;t VERIFY that my senses are liars, nor can I verify that I&apos;m a brain in a jar!  How does THAT taste, Utahraptor?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  You can verify the science thing!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: If I&apos;m going to be verificationist, I&apos;d better figure out what it means to say that something is true!  I&apos;m going to start with... relativism!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This one is all, &quot;Well, it&apos;s true for me!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Guys.  Come on.  This is the dumbest theory of truth.  This is the theory of truth that draws tattoos on itself in blue pen and then when you ask why anyone would draw a picture on their forearm of tree, with sausages, with the words &quot;sausage tree&quot; beneath it, it gets mad and says &quot;You don&apos;t understand my truth!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m - I&apos;m personifying a little here but that&apos;s seriously what relativism does.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What about fascist truth, where something is true because those with power say it&apos;s true?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Again - ultra dumb!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What I want is a theory of truth that&apos;s incontrovertible.  In fact, I don&apos;t want even a THEORY of truth!  I want a fact of truth.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re not going to get it!  There&apos;s like 20 trillion theories, but no facts.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh YEAH??  We&apos;ll see about that!</line>
				<line>Narrator: TWENTY TRILLION THEORIES OF TRUTH LATER:</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Wait, I know some truths that are absolute: mathematical truths! How could I have been so blind?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It is a FACT that one plus one equals two!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: All I need is a way to convert mathematical truths to the real world and I WILL NEVER BE WRONG AGAIN!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Um - I&apos;m sorry to break it to you, T-Rex, but mathematical truths aren&apos;t absolute either. Math is built on a priori assumptions: you start with a few things that you assume are true and build on them! Stuff like &quot;1+2 is the same as 2+1&quot;. Then you build up a mathematical system around that, but that doesn&apos;t mean math is true. It&apos;s just - consistent!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But... 1+2 IS the same as 2+1!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Or so you think, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Damn my potentially-flawed senses!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: When our mathematical assumptions APPEAR to match up with reality, the results may also seem to apply - but math isn&apos;t any more &quot;true&quot; because of that! It&apos;s still based on unproven/unprovable assumptions. And you can actually build up systems where you decide that 1+2 does not equal 2+1, and they&apos;re just as consistent!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Attention, everyone I&apos;ve ever met and ever will meet! Never mention the &quot;flawed senses&quot; idea again, okay? It prevents me from knowing absolute truth.</line>

No. I will say &quot;wicked sweettimes&quot; and then I would say &quot;what did you get me&quot; and then I would say &quot;I bet it&apos;s so awesome&quot; and that will be that.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Cargo cults are religions that have developed during World War II in island tribal societies exposed to the West!  Islanders saw planes delivering amazing and valuable cargo to the troops, and believed it to be divine.</line>
				<line>Narrator: KARGO KULT KOMICS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: During the war, the islanders would see this cargo going to the troops and would grow to believe that the gods meant it for them - that the white people were just getting it sooner because of their influential rituals.  And of couse, after the war ended and the troops left, the cargo stopped being dropped too.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So what happened then?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The islanders started mimicking what they&apos;d seen the troops doing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The result was ersatz marches, imitation airstrips and walkie talkies made out of wood and bamboo, and even torch signal flares, used to signal divine planes that never come!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Wow!  It recasts Western military culture and tools as religious practice and iconography, respectively!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  I know!  It&apos;s CRAZY!  Not in the pejorative sense, but in the more esoteric &quot;Holy crap the Prime Directive on Star Trek was RIGHT&quot; sense of crazy.  It&apos;s a very particular sense of crazy but I&apos;m feeling it right now!</line>

				<line>Narrator: EARLIER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What if I started my OWN waterslide, but put a fine layer of gasoline on top, and then lit it, so that when you slide you could slide through FIRE (EXTREME!!), but then if it got too hot, you&apos;d just have to go underwater to &quot;cool down&quot;?</line>
				<line>God: NO</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;d give you a FREE pass!</line>
				<line>God: GONNA HAVE TO STICK WITH NOPERS HERE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What if I made... carbonated CARBON?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s a terrible idea!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It doesn&apos;t even make sense. If you carbonate a solid the best you&apos;re gonna get is a solid with carbon dioxide bubbles in it. And if you&apos;ve done that you&apos;ve probably come up with Swiss cheese, so upon closer inspection I think this is a great idea as I would actually like some Swiss cheese, please.</line>

				<line>God: OKAY SO HERE&apos;S WHAT THEY&apos;RE LIKE</line>
				<line>Narrator: THIS MORNING:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sorry, other word classes!  I have a NEW girlfriend now!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A homographic homophonic autantonym is a word that is spelt AND pronounced the same, but has two opposite and contradictory meanings!  For example, I can dust a crop (adding pesticides to it), or I can dust a counter (removing dust from it)!  Way to go, dust!  You are a winner; you are a word that contains multitudes.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Why do we let language get like this?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Probably because we want it to be incredibly awesome?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And both &quot;dust&quot;s are the same part of speech there, too, so you can&apos;t use word order to determine meaning!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: INDEED!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ALL YOU CAN DO is hope to use your real-world knowledge about crops and tables to figure out what&apos;s going on.  And it&apos;s even worse with words like &quot;overlook&quot;, meaning &quot;examine&quot; but ALSO meaning &quot;miss noticing entirely&quot;.  Can&apos;t rely on the noun there!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How come you love words that make communication difficult?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What is not to like?  They&apos;re words that do their job in the most sarcastic, sullen, passive-aggressive way possible, and they totally get away with it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I just want to pat them on the head and ruffle their hair, you know?</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Further, T-Rex, they go on to observe that &quot;One bad apple spreads decay to other apples stored nearby. An entire barrel can easily be ruined in this manner.&quot;</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Hey, have you noticed how our proverbs are - a little awkward?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Now that you mention it, I have!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Columbus popularizes the continent!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And afterwards, what happens is what cooks call the &quot;Columbian explosion&quot;, where fruits and vegetables brought back from the new world have a profound effect on the cooking in the old one! Tomatoes and potatoes are but two of the best-rhyming examples. When people back home discovered these vegetables, they started experimenting with them and coming up with all sorts of crazy, YET DELICIOUS, dishes! The Columbian explosion was an explosion of TASTE.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And now, Italian food is basically defined by the tomato!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And we don&apos;t think &quot;Irish cooking&quot; without &quot;potato&quot;, and South Korean food is big on Western peppers too! It must have been an exciting time, trying these new meals that nobody on the continent had ever tasted.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And they were SO GOOD, they supplemented or replaced existing cultural dishes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It makes me wish we could have something like that, you know? I&apos;m TIRED of the same old vegetables.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay MAYBE there were some downsides to the Columbian explosion.  The old world got tomatoes and potatoes, AND corn and peanuts, AND rubber, AND cocoa, and in exchange gave the new world... lettuce?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And also horses!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And also the cholera and influenza and bubonic plague and typhoid fever, and um, smallpox.  So basically the world got this explosion of new and tasty times, but also this exchange of disease, and just about every culture on Earth was affected.  But what&apos;s neat is that we can look forward to the same thing if we ever encounter alien life!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Except it&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;d be vulnerable to their diseases.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well... MAYBE.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But we don;t know anything about alien life!  Maybe they&apos;ll look just like us AND share diseases with us, but with pointier ears.  And logic?</line>

Antonio smiled appreciatively.  &apos;There are so many bad laws passed through a misunderstanding of how computers actually work,&apos; he thought.  Amelia&apos;s breasts were pretty great.  Antonio was hot too but THIS omniscient third-person narrator is into the ladies.</line>

It&apos;s also used by marine biologists, and dads, when they are taking their kids to visit marine biologists. IT&apos;S NOT EVEN A GOOD JOKE! You are using the word &quot;whale&quot; when talking about a whale. That&apos;s not comedy! That&apos;s a literal use of adjectives.</line>

				<line>Narrator: IT&apos;S WEDNESDAY!  HOW ARE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS</line>
				<line>T-rex: I would rate my relationships:</line>
				<line>T-rex: Pretty okay!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: My relationships are fine too!  I broke up with the guy I was dating, but it&apos;s cool.</line>
				<line>T-rex: What was the reason?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: He punned too often?  And they weren&apos;t even, like, good puns.  They were always the same puns.</line>
				<line>T-rex: Sometimes you want to eat corn without hearing how corny it is.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: This is what I&apos;m saying!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: My relationships are fine too!</line>
				<line>T-rex: How Are They?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: WELL, I&apos;ve been seeing this new guy, and it&apos;s nice.  We went out to a movie last night and he held my hand when the lights went down.  It was classy!  And things are good with you?</line>
				<line>T-rex: Yep!  Let me tell you man, these days when the phone rings, I think it might be a girl!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I have recently acquired some snake oil, and it has inspired me to compile a list of professions that have been ruined by lexicalized phrases!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: First: snake oil salesmen!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Since the phrase now means &quot;con artist&quot;, nobody wants to be a snake oil salesman! But I presume there was a point when a man could procure some snake oil and go door-to-door selling it, and maybe those guys wrecked it for the rest of us. Maybe they were all chumps. MAYBE they were all, in fact, SUPERCHUMPS.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That may actually be the case!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I knew it!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, early Western entrepreneurs tried to duplicate the successful Chinese snake oil they saw, but it failed to recognize the reason it had SOME effect was Chinese water snakes are high in eicosapentaenic acid, an anti inflammatory agent! Western snakes aren&apos;t, and so their medicine didn&apos;t work.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But they sold it anyway, often as a universal panacea!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: PANACEA?! THAT&apos;S THE SECRET WORD OF THE DAY!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: OH MY GOD. I just realized that yesterday when Utahraptor said &quot;universal panacea&quot;, he was using a pleonasm!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: (Pleonasm is the use of redundant, unnecessary words to express an idea!)</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah hah! This is Utahraptor: &quot;Hey, T-Rex, do you want to drink some cola-flavoured Coca-Cola brand carbonated cola beverages? Perhaps afterwards we&apos;ll take the public transport large road vehicle bus and buy with money or credit some submarine sub sandwiches?&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s TOTALLY HIM, Domiceiomimus!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: IT WAS A STYLISTIC CHOICE!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sorry? Could your vocal chords and mouth repeat that?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Pleonasms have legitimate uses! For example, if I wasn&apos;t sure my audience (YOU, T-Rex) would know what &quot;panacea&quot; meant, I might use a similar word, allowing you to deduce some of my semantics without needing an explanation.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe after the subs sandwiches we could go to a water lake beach shore?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We could go to the water lake beach shore in our water lake beach shore swimming shorts for swimming? In water?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You know what? FINE.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Science dudes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I have some bad news!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think that time travel might not actually be possible!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Because say I travel to the future and take back some sweet future technology: let us say, hoverbikes.  Nice!  And then people in the present can examine the hoverbikes and see how they work to duplicate them, which is also nice, until we get to the future and the guy who invented hoverbikes won&apos;t do it anymore because they&apos;ve already been invented!  He doesn&apos;t want to be a copycat.  Assume for the sake of argument that he doesn&apos;t want to be a copycat.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So, what?  You&apos;ve got a paradox!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The creativity that was required to create hoverbikes has been erased!  Who had the insight now?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s a paradox!  Those are what happen when you travel through time.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But they&apos;re inventions without an inventor and you can do the same thing with works of art!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Aging?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Also, making weird noises.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, yesterday I&apos;m sitting there and my belly kind of goes &quot;tweeeeet?&quot; like it&apos;s a, a, a bird or something.  What&apos;s with you, belly?  I know you&apos;re there, yes!  I don&apos;t need a &quot;tweeeeet&quot; to say hello.  I just put food in you and that is gonna have to be INTRODUCTION ENOUGH.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Got any other body complaints?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: As a matter of fact, I DO.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: One, my body needs to survive in space, two, it needs to be able to eat paper in an emergency, three, flight would be nice, also, four, sometimes when I&apos;m sleeping I get a cramp in my leg muscles and I have to punch the muscles.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Four is the worst?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Four is the worst!  Also, FIVE, I wish my body would poop more instead of putting on weight.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor (off-screen): Okay! I&apos;m done with this conversation.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No, seriously!  Because -</line>

				<line>Narrator: SITUATIONS IN WHICH TO USE &quot;THAT&apos;S WHAT SHE SAID!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: There are many situations in which &quot;that&apos;s what she said!&quot; may be appropriately used! For example, after someone says, uh,</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;What a good date!&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: That&apos;s TERRIBLE. T-Rex, you&apos;re supposed to use it to recontextualize an innocuous statement into a double entendre, not to indicate that both people on the date were happy. Here, say it after I stop talking. &quot;You can stay in my guest house for a week.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what SHE said!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: See? Actually, no, that&apos;s not so great either.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, you can use &quot;that&apos;s what she said!&quot; when telling a story, too!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Literally?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, like - &quot;Anneke said &apos;How do you do.&apos; To clarify, that&apos;s what SHE said!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ug. Here, look: &quot;T-Rex, that certainly took a long time and I didn&apos;t enjoy it at all.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what SHE said!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hah!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Finally! Normally this isn&apos;t so hard!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: There certainly is a lot of climate that&apos;s CHANGING, right? Right?! Can I get a witness?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Or MAYBE, climate isn&apos;t changing at all. Or maybe it is, but who cares because it&apos;s all someone else&apos;s fault!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: or maybe the climate is supposed to change because we all got new swimmin&apos; trunks</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That is without exaggeration, T-Rex, the weakest comment on climate change that I have ever heard, or am ever likely to hear!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;ve distilled an important issue down to &quot;something might be happening I dunno, maybe??&quot; Also, you don&apos;t even mention human influence on the climate, which is a serious concern!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Serious concern? I just stepped on a tiny woman, so her only influence on the climate is that now she&apos;s dead.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In the climate.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Right now she&apos;s probably saying &quot;OH MAN WHAT A CHANGE FOR ME! A CLIMATE CHANGE, THAT IS!!&quot;</line>

				<line>Narrator: STORIES FOR MEN</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Men! We like stories, right?</line>
				<line>Three voices outside the picture: Right!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But they have to be good stories. Stories with plots in which there are good guys and bad guys, and then some explosions happen to them!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: You sure like explosions, huh?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In a good story, they function as punctuation marks. Hamlet says &quot;To be or not to be&quot;, and the building behind him blows up. It is spectacular. The audience whispers, &quot;Yes. This is what Shakespeare meant.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So your story is Hamlet only with explosions instead of punctuation.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You say it like it&apos;s not fantastic!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Do the characters even react to the explosions at all?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sometimes they go off in the background and they barely glance over their shoulder at them. Sometimes they outrun them down halls or by climbing up ladders real fast. It depends on the scene, you know?</line>
				<line>Narrator: THE ULTIMATE STORY FOR MEN</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hamlet sips some whiskey while punching a man in the nose! Ophelia says she&apos;s crazy for him and they go on a helicopter ride. A ghost appears, and when Hamlet high fives him he explodes! Then Denmark explodes.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: There was a man freestyle rapping outside my window last night.</line>
				<line>Narrator: EARLIER:</line>
				<line>Freestyle Rap Man: My name&apos;s not important and I&apos;m here to say / That I&apos;ve been outside rapping for most of today!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It was pretty okay! His rhymes were moderately tight, too!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: When was this?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: About 4am! I woke up to it, which was surreal. It ended when I guess someone dissed him from across the street or behind some bushes or something? Heyelled &quot;Who said that?!&quot; and ran off down the street.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Was the rap directed at you, T-Rex? Were you being &quot;rap serenaded&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No, man!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It was like he was walking down the street rapping to himself, and just happened to stop outside my place when his flow got going. I can respect that! I kinda want to be that guy, you know?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What was he rapping about?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: All sorts of topics, really!</line>
				<line>Narrator: EARLIER:</line>
				<line>Freestyle Rap Man: My freestyle rap is a bunch of crap; I got low self esteem and that&apos;s about that</line>
				<line>T-Rex&apos;s thoughts: Awww!</line>
				<line>Freestyle Rap Man: Wait, my esteem got a lot better / When my grandmom bought me that nice new sweater!</line>
				<line>T-Rex&apos;s thoughts: Grandmoms are great for that!</line>

		<title>based on a true story in which fedex failed to deliver a package to me, oh, four times now</title>

			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: AMAZING AND TRUE STORIES FROM THE LIFE OF UTAHRAPTOR</line>
				<line>Narrator: also starring T-REX</line>
				<line>Narrator: This morning I skipped breakfast and met T-Rex for lunch. He seemed excited. He always seems excited.</line>
				<line>Narrator: I asked him why, and it turned out that Dromiceiomimus had a customer service issue with a shipping company, and wanted T-Rex to call because he&apos;s better at these sorts of things. They&apos;d failed to deliver her package four times now. T-Rex already has &quot;suckified delivery companies&quot; on his revenge list (he&apos;d said), so he was pleased to call. He spent ten minutes listing all the ways suckified delivery companies had made his life worse, got a full head of steam, and called them up. Long story short, the package had actually been delivered that morning. T-Rex claims victory.</line>
				<line>Narrator: I actually ran into him (almost literally) later that afternoon, and we discussed it some more.</line>
				<line>Narrator: My contrarian position (I freely admit it) was that he was wrong to chew out the lady on the phone: with companies this size, there&apos;s no way she was responsible for the package. Responsibility is so diffused that really, nobody is responsible - it&apos;s a system failure, and the person in the call centre can&apos;t change the system. He replied that as his only contact point, agents should expect complaints and offer solutions - he&apos;s not going to make allowances for someone else&apos;s broken system. We agreed to differ.</line>
				<line>Narrator: I realize that this is my diary for the new year, and all I&apos;ve written about so far is T-Rex. the responsibility for this, I feel, lies solely in this Christmas gift &quot;stationary&quot; from T-Rex himself. He&apos;s drawn himself in every panel, and the same pre-printed title takes up all the space in the first one. Still - grocery shopping&apos;s more fun.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: pick up eggs</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I&apos;m listening!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So I went to the chiropractor, right? And he examined me and said &quot;what happened to your back?&quot; and I smiled at him and I said &quot;well, Doc, let me tell you the BACKstory!&quot;</line>

And then there&apos;ll be a day shortly afterwards when we can simulate universe on our cell phones!  And once you imagine this possibility, what are the odds that OUR universe is the one real one?

		<title>t-rex is doing &quot;i am legend&quot; for ghosts. the reason the poltergeists break so many dishes isn&apos;t that they&apos;re throwing them around! they&apos;re just bumping into them because they can&apos;t see</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Ghost have got to be the saddest thing ever! They&apos;re dead people PLUS they&apos;re blind.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s right, I said it! Ghosts are blind!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They HAVE to be, because they&apos;re invisible! And light needs to hit something to be seen, and if ghosts have transparent eyes they&apos;re not going to see anything. PLUS you can walk right through a ghost, so sound waves will pass through them too. They&apos;re deaf and blind most of the time, and when they do become a little visible, the world that fades into focus around them is filled with people screaming at them in terror. It&apos;s so sad!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re picking apart the science of ghost senses, but accept the fact of their invisibility?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ghosts have to be invisible, at least part of the time - that&apos;s what makes them ghosts! But if you accept that, it&apos;s fun to try to see how ghostlike you can make them without making any FURTHER assumptions.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But our friend Zach is a ghost, and he&apos;s not blind OR deaf!</line>
				<line>T-Rex&apos;s thought bubble: Aw, heck.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So Prometheus&apos; liver is a perfectly clean, natural and renewable fuel source!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He doles out to the world a small amount of an INFINITE SUPPLY of biofeul daily.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Way to go, Prometheus!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Seems like a pretty painful way to go through life!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Still, it&apos;s not that bad.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What about Cassandra, prescient but cursed so that nobody believes her?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Screw everyone else!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: She can avoid falling pianos and win the lottery.</line>

		<title>guys, my med student friend is now my doctor friend! let&apos;s hear it for her success and her knowledge about what, in particular, makes bodies gross!</title>
		<body>

				<line>T-Rex: Ssh!  Come closer!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know more secrets!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: More SECRETS of the MEDICAL PROFESSION!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so peritonitis is when your peritoneum gets infected, and the peritoneum is basically the lining for your abdominal cavity, where your guts are!  So if that&apos;s infected, you&apos;re going to be in pain whenever your belly moves.  And when the doctor walks in the room, he might see how you&apos;re sitting, cautious in your movements, guarding your belly, and he might suspect peritonitis.  And then he might &quot;accidentally&quot; bump into your bed or chair!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you start to scream from just that small bump, he&apos;ll know the peritonitis is bad!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But why all the subterfuge?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, they can just come up and say &quot;I&apos;m going to shake your belly so tell me if it hurts&quot;, but that primes the patient, and they&apos;ll be LOOKING to feel pain.  The bump can get you an unsolicited result and lets you quickly ascertain degree!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So if you scream, they suspect bad-times peritonitis.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!  And then they&apos;ll send you for emergency surgery.  Did you know that one of peritonitis&apos; causes is your BOWELS becoming PERFORATED so that RAW SEWAGE sloshes around in your belly?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Man, bodies are nasty!  I can TOTALLY SEE why nascent machine intelligences don&apos;t wanna hang with us.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: My last attempt to be a motivational speaker didn&apos;t go so well.  But this time I have a plan: GENERATIVE ADVICE.  For example!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Customers know what they want, but they want what they know!&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Wow, that actually sounds like good business advice, T-Rex.  Customers want to buy something they&apos;re already familiar with!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know, right?  But I totally just made it up, according to my Generative Advice Formula.  And I have tons more!  Like, for a restaurant: &quot;Customers eat what they see, but they see what they eat.&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: That one is less impressive.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe because it follows the first one?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Your formula is &quot;Customers VERB1 what they VERB2, but they VERB2 what they VERB1&quot;, for all transitive verbs, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay YEAH it&apos;s obvious, but it works!  And it can be customized to any environment.  Self-help?  &quot;Do what you want, but want what you do.&quot;  Writers?  &quot;Write what you know, but know what you write.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Oh, yeah?  What about colonists?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Colonize what you explore, but explore what you colonize.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Zookeepers!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Tame what you keep, but please, keep what you tame.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Nurses?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Nurses take care of the injured, but they injure who they take care of.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, whatever!  My formula is still good DESPITE nurse racism.</line>

		<title>how great would it be to compare versions of hamlet from universe 1 and universe a, noting the way the plot unfolds differently, the subtle changes in word choice, the way the character of Ophelia was merged with Polonius? PRETTY GREAT, I IMAGINE!!</title>

				<line>T-Rex: Building a time machine is hard!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But maybe, building a time machine to an alternate universe: NOT SO HARD??</line>
				<line>T-Rex: See, Dromiceiomimus, my new plan is to visit alternate universes to take back objects and ideas from them! Hopefully that will be much easier than using godless science to violate the natural laws of time?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So it&apos;s the same old &quot;steal technology from the future&quot; idea?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A little! But a lot of alternate universes would probably be at about the same tech level. What I&apos;m really interested in is culture!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re hoping that in alternate universes, you&apos;ll get alternate versions of Hamlet!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s a great example. Shakespeare wrote some fantastic plays, but there&apos;s only so many of them. But infinite parallel Shakespeares on infinite parallel typewriters pretty much have to give us some terrific pieces of literature!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: New ideas and themes from the Bard WOULD really be something!</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE IN UNIVERSE x95:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Shakespeare is the greatest author in history, but all he&apos;s written is 38 plays and 154 sonnets about &quot;how much [he] likes to gaze at yonder bosoms&quot;!</line>

		<title>anyway a week later t-rex is forced to go through with this and kisses a guy who found out he only has a month to live. it doesn&apos;t work out and the last month ends up being super awkward for everyone involved. the end!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Some people do not cherish awkward moments as I do. Lukily for them, I have come up with a solution!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The solution, as in most things, is smooching!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Awkward moments are awkward because nobody knows what to do or say. But if you swoop in for a kiss, it&apos;s no longer an awkward moment! You&apos;ve avoided it entirely by transitioning it into a moment of &quot;OH GREAT WHAT THE HACK NOW I HAVE TO SLAP THIS PERSON FOR THEIR UNWANTED ADVANCES&quot; or even a moment of &quot;OH GREAT WHAT THE HECK NOW THEY LOVE ME TOO&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I feel like you haven&apos;t thought this out, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I - I really do.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: My friend, if you&apos;re going to be doing that much kissing, you&apos;d better brush up a bit on it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: 	wHAT?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m serious! If you kiss someone and it&apos;s a sucky kiss, that just escalates the awkward moment!  And I don&apos;t mean to brag, but I&apos;m a pretty great kisser.  One time I kissed a guy and he said, UNSOLICITED, that it was the best kiss he&apos;d ever had.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Seriously? Can you teach me?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: with - words?</line>
				<line>Narrator: THAT EVENING:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nobody even noticed how I made my examples of the awkward moment kiss gender neutral!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s so you can imagine a man slapping a woman after an unwanted kiss, and then you get to examine your ideas of gender roles and heteronormativity</line>

		<title>what is the upper bound on the speed of the treadmill, given perfect manufacturing techniques? i imply it&apos;s terminal velocity but i really don&apos;t know. randall? any help?</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I would like to have an inclined treadmill, so that I could build an indoor skateboarding track.  Am I that crazy?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Am I that crazy... TO DREAM?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The idea is that it&apos;s like a moving sidewalk, but the speed is computer controlled!  So you hop on your skateboard and get on the track, and within a few moments the speed of the treadmill is exactly matching the speed your board would otherwise be travelling at!  You&apos;re not moving, but the board FEELS like it&apos;s travelling at speed.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The slogan will be, &quot;Yes.  You can skateboard in your apartment in winter.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So it&apos;s like a reverse Segway, only the computer controls speed by moving the ground, instead of the wheels.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But can you imagine how fun it would be, to have that sensation of movement indoors, while not actually moving?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And hey, if you fall, you&apos;ll be whipped backwards at the speed you were travelling at!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Here&apos;s a solution to that!  DON&apos;T FALL DOWN??</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But you&apos;re describing a virtual infinite hill.  The treadmill will eventually have to be moving at terminal velocity!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh yeah, NOBODY is gonna want to buy the TERMINAL VELOCITY SKATEBOARD SIMULATOR.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I just -</line>
				<line>T-Rex: EXTREME! !</line>

		<title>THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER CONCERNS AS WELL.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so whatever. MAYBE the Terminal Velocity Skateboard Simulator would never reach terminal velocity, since there&apos;s no wind resistance. But do we not have an obligation to future generations to make sure??</line>
				<line>Narrator: NOPE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Whatever! If I were in the future and I could open up a book and see &quot;The awesome terminal velocity skateboard didn&apos;t work, OH WELL&quot;, then I would do that.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I don&apos;t think you would, T-Rex! Because you could basically do that today, if you wanted to read up on the physics. The issue is that even with the ground moving, the board is going to slide down the ramp because of gravity.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ridiculous! There&apos;s friction in the wheels that -</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: - wouldn&apos;t be enough!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The treadmill speeds up to match the board&apos;s forward momentum, right? But if you&apos;ve got impossibly perfect bearings, that&apos;s just going to make the wheels go faster while the board still slides down. So it&apos;s just the friction in the bearings that can keep you in place, and at the levels we&apos;re talking about, your wheels would melt first!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: FINE. You know what? FINE. I&apos;m done dreaming!</line>
				<line>{{In T-Rex&apos;s thoughts.}} Bathroom symbol for women: t-rex we symbolically represent sexy babes who forgot our clothes today! wooo!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, NOW I&apos;m done dreaming.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Guys! Guys!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I came up with a way to get my skateboard treadmill to work!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: All I need is a treadmill that tilts!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That way, rather than relying on friction and stuff to manage the position of the skateboarder, I can just tilt the incline up or down in order to keep them in the right position. Then, hey presto, it works and physics is happy! FOR ONCE.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Alternatively, I could have a giant fan, like the kind used in skydiving simulators, and use air to help keep the skateboarder where I want him to be.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Both of these seem like pretty expensive solutions!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s true!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And I realized: if I do have this giant fan, it&apos;ll be way more fun to use it OFFENSIVELY than it&apos;d be to simulate skating indoors. So anyway, I bought the fan, installed it on my house and now I blow enemies off my lawn.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ha, no way!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor. It&apos;s so awesome.</line>

		<title>if anyone wants to make a new dinosaur comics game, the premise from yesterday&apos;s comic (t-rex using a giant fan to blow enemies off his lawn) seems as great a premise as any.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Wouldn&apos;t it be great if people didn&apos;t need to be happy?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: YES.  Yes it probably would!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I mean, I get that depression (UNhappiness) has a host of issues associated with it, but what I&apos;m describing is more Ahappiness - the ability to not need happiness at all!  Happiness is this - this FUEL that we need to function in society, but it doesn&apos;t last forever, and then we need to find more.  It&apos;s like food, only it&apos;s drained every time we have to do something sucky!  Also, you can&apos;t buy happiness at a grocery store.  I&apos;m sorry, Safeway, but you just CAN&apos;T.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But what if I removed that desire for happiness?  What if instead of feeding the world, I simply killed hunger?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This is crazy!  You can&apos;t just pluck an emotion out of the psyche, and we don&apos;t have technology that even approaches this.  When did you ever think you were going to do this?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Do this?&quot; Utahraptor, do you seriously think I&apos;d explain my masterstroke if there was the slightest chance of you affecting it&apos;s outcome?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I did it thirty-five minutes ago.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah, just kidding!  I tried to come up with a way to suppress happiness, but I&apos;m not HAPPY with the results yet.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: BAH DUM DUM CHING??</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Before I used to dread the &quot;what are you doing with your life&quot; question, but not anymore!  This is because I&apos;ve decided what I&apos;m doing with my life: creating SHAKESPEARE VIDEO GAMES.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Could this TRULY be the greatest calling ever?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And I already have tons of ideas, like &quot;Richard the Third the Game&quot;!  In the introductory thematic you trade your kingdom for a horse, and then you spend the rest of the game riding around your old kingdom on a horse.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So it&apos;s a platformer?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: With stealth elements!  Your horse isn&apos;t very good, and so sometimes you&apos;re embarrassed about your horse, and then you have to sneak around.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You really think people want to ride around on a platforming horse as Richard the Third?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know I do!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So, what, the ice level is called &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No, that&apos;s dumb.  The ice level is called &quot;Oh, no!  King Richard The Third Has Chilly Pants.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Look, I&apos;m going to prototype it tonight, so by this time tomorrow, we&apos;ll see what&apos;s what.</line>
				<line>Narrator: THE NEXT DAY:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So, Utahraptor!  What do you think?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This is just a picture of Richard the Third&apos;s head on Duke Nukem&apos;s body.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So its not going well?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I CAN&apos;T EVEN GET RICHARD THE THIRD TO MOVE.  You know what my game is now?  My game is NIBBLES, with the text changed from &quot;Copyright Microsoft 1990&quot; to &quot;man, forget this&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Programming&apos;s a skill!</line>

I don&apos;t need to know the difference between friggin&apos; binary and B+ search trees!  ALL I WANT TO KNOW is how to make Richard III&apos;s sucky horse do double jumps, you know?</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I have a problem. I have come into possession of a pin from the 1935 Nuremberg Rally, and I really don&apos;t know what to do with it. Hitler&apos;s face is on the pin. It&apos;s a Nazi pin! *I* have a Nazi pin!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is not good news for Team T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m trapped! I can&apos;t just throw it out, because it&apos;s History. But there&apos;s no way I&apos;m selling it, either: I don&apos;t want to profit from, um, NAZIS, and I wouldn&apos;t want to sell to anyone who&apos;d be interested in buying it anyway.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Where&apos;d you get it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My grandfather died a few months ago and I was given this part of his estate. He found it after the war, in the rafters of a house he bought!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Man! I don&apos;t want to go through life as a Nazi pin guy!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Why not just give it away?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: To whom? &quot;Hi! You seem like a woman who appreciates her Nazi memorabilia&quot;? No, I can&apos;t just pass this off on someone else: it just shifts these issues onto them. I&apos;ve got to handle this myself.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But how?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ll think of something!</line>
				<line>Narrator: THAT EVENING:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What if I started wearing it under a shirt when I go out? That way, if I got hit by a car, the discovery of the pin will ENTIRELY OVERSHADOW anything I&apos;ve ever accomplished in my life!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I could say this is one situation in which the free market fails! But I won&apos;t!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I can already see where that would go: a discussion of how style sells cars and bumpers are subject to that, but how government controls could legislate that all bumpers be a standard height, thereby saving lives. THEN, we could segue into internationalization problems with how foreign car makers might not want to redesign their cars for only our market, but we still need cars, so hey, let&apos;s talk corporate control over our national interests!

				<line>T-Rex: Then he falls down the stairs!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Then he smashes through a load-bearing beam at the bottom and his house collapses! And then a spark from a broken lamp ignites the gas, and his house explodes, shooting the guy out into the sky and lighting the surrounding houses on fire.

				<line>T-Rex: Normally people have trouble with sequels after their first idea is so, and I&apos;ll say it, so transcendentally brilliant. But not me! I have ideas for basically infinite sequels.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Basically infinite out-of-genre cover sequels, that is!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: When my explosion-centric disaster movie comes out and people want more, I will say to them, &quot;No, ACTUALLY, you want the same thing, but this time, as a gross-out comedy!&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So the story starts out the same, but the guy slips on some lube and then lands in an old jock strap!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah! PRECISELY. And it keeps happening throughout the film. The power goes out, and nationwide, folks slip on the lube.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The next sequel could be a road trip movie!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: EVEN BETTER.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Some TEENS go out on a road trip and unwittingly stay just ahead of all the destruction! You can see it in the background of some of the shots, but they never notice...because they are all too busy learning about friendship!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I like it! Dozens of sequels, all revolving around the same story!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A western! A loner cowboy, caught between wilderness and civilization, enters the nation and tries to stop the disasters!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Does he succeed?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No. He shoots a lot of guys while failing to stop it, though!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;There is a showdown between a cowboy and a volcano.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: THE AMAZING STORY OF EDWARD S. CURTIS. Edward S. Curtis was a photographer of American Indians in the early 1900s! I know he was tough because his middle name was &quot;Sheriff&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For most of his life he documented the disappearing &quot;great race&quot; of the Indian!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He took over 40 thousand photographs - not bad for one guy! And in many cases, his records are the only recorded history we&apos;ve got. But what&apos;s amazing about Curtis is that he specifically set out to record the doomed people his culture imagined Indians to be: the noble savage, the Indian that was alien, stoic, exotic and dying.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And when he met Indians that DIDN&apos;T meet his expectations, he just changed them for his photographs.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Man, he carried boxes of &quot;Indian&quot; clothing and wigs with him: ethnic signifiers for his subjects if they didn&apos;t look Indian enough! And his Indian was clean-shaven, so he&apos;d pay men to shave.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s an interesting conflict in the guy: record the Indian before they &quot;die out&quot;, but already know what you want to see.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep! I think it&apos;s amazing how we&apos;ve still got this idea of the Indian that we look for. If there&apos;s no headdress we&apos;re disappointed!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Only if we&apos;re RACIST, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Everybody&apos;s friggin&apos; racist!</line>

They also wish their kisses were neverending, as that would be nice, and they wish they were all married, they&apos;d be happy. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t [that] be nice?&quot;, they ask each other in the chorus, largely rhetorically.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: They&apos;re talking to a GIRL, T-Rex, not each other!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So heteronormative!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Listen, if there&apos;s a group of people on stage and they start out throwing out &quot;wouldn&apos;t it be nice if WE were older&quot;s, I don&apos;t imagine a hypothetical female third party! I look at THEM.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t need a laptop battery! All I want is a spooky skull, so that when criminals break into my house, they see a grim visage of things to come.</line>

		<title>william shakespeare: &quot;now cracks a noble heart. good-night, sweet prince; and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.&quot; ryan north: &quot;shakespeare was a famous writer guy&quot;</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Shakespeare was a famous writer guy, but we know basically nothing about him!  There&apos;s only a handful of times when we know what he was doing on a given day.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And at other times, there&apos;s no record of him for years and years!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The fact that we have any record of him as a person at all is only due to the fact that he appeared in court a few times as a witness, and that he got married.  Legal records are all we&apos;ve got!  His interests and tastes, politics and loves &quot;#8212; they all have to be (unreliably) extrapolated from his writing.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Well, he IS from the past, and 80% of the plays from his time survive as titles alone!  We&apos;re lucky to have the data we do.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s true!  I just wish we knew more about the man, you know?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re not alone in that!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So let&apos;s agree!  If one of us ever get a chance to go back in time, and we run into him, then we&apos;ll definitely ask Shakespeare what he was up to.  What he likes, what his interests are &quot;#8212; all the stuff historians wish they had!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hah!  Okay, it&apos;s a deal!</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: SHAKESPEARE!  OH SHAKESPEARE!  DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY CAR KEYS ARE, SHAKESPEARE</line>
				<line>Shakespeare: alack me!  i&apos;m trying to write some sonnets here, t-rex!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: BEFORE we had dictionaries, words could be spelt in a variety of different ways. Now that we have dictionaries, spellings are fixed.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This I accept!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It speeds up reading AND comprehension, and spelling errors give editors &quot;easy points&quot; when looking for something to edit.  FINE.  But we&apos;ve lost the ability to encode the way words are spoken: the pronunciation and accents of a speaker!  We can get a little of that back through capitalization and creative! punctuation! but still - it&apos;s hard in text to tell an Australian from an American, assuming they&apos;re both speaking English.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The result of this is a proliferation of stereotypes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How so?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, say I&apos;m writing a story about Australian Batman and I want to show people that Batman&apos;s Australian now. Spelling means I can&apos;t rely on his accent, so I&apos;m forced to have him call people &quot;mate&quot; and grimly refer to &quot;shrimps&quot; placed upon &quot;barbies&quot;. It&apos;s the only way!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Um - pretty sure there are others!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And FINALLY, you could just have the narration mention the fact that Batman&apos;s Australian, and leave it at that. You don&apos;t need to rely on pseudoracist sterotypes!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Tableau vivant, or &quot;tableau&quot; is a form of theatre in which the actors strike a pose and then don&apos;t move! It&apos;s like a living picture. It is, in fact, French for &quot;living picture&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And I am the kind of tableau, my friends! Check it out:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ...TABLEAU!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Um, you&apos;re not supposed to speak during tableau, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Beg pardon?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s motionless AND silent. Interestingly enough, it was favored by early art photographers, as they already needed their subjects to stay motionless for minutes at a time.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh. Interesting.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Anyway. I&apos;m still the best at tableau.</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE T-REX ACTUALLY IS THE BEST AT TABLEAU:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: TABLEAU!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: {{thought bubble}} I must keep the other actors from discovering my secret to excellent tableau.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: {{thought bubble}} It&apos;s a very competitive business.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Students! Are you having trouble writing essays? Maybe they&apos;re a little short?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe just a little?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well then, here are some friggin&apos; tips!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so everyone knows about making margins wide and using a big font, but teachers know that one too. They see it and they think &quot;Come on, you can do better,&quot; and then they uncap their red pens and write &quot;You could use some friggin&apos; tips!&quot; all over your cover page.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Has that ever happened to you?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope! But that&apos;s because *I* happen to use a little friggin&apos; thing called &quot;tips&quot;!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So let&apos;s hear these tips then!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Prepare yourself to be friggin&apos; fipped, my friend!</line>
				<line>Ben Chuckles: CUT!</line>
				<line>Ben Chuckles: I&apos;m sorry, but we don&apos;t think you&apos;re right for the role. We&apos;re really looking for an actor who doesn&apos;t add &quot;friggin&apos;&quot; to each of his lines.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well then!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Easy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example, here&apos;s a tip! Maybe you could try understanding the topic at hand and expressing your views on it in a clear yet persuasive manner?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: When I was in high school, I&apos;d increase the font size on all my periods from 12 points to 14 points, thereby extending my paper in a way that was very difficult to detect!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dromieciomimus! I am shocked!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Man, I just added &quot;very&quot; in front of my adjectives!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What? For reals?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Of course! It was a great way to extend the length of my essay, AND it made my points more emphatic. &quot;Trees are tall and pretty&quot; became &quot;Trees are very tall and very very pretty. Verily!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What, you were The Mighty Thor?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Only in essays, my friend! Only in essays.</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hello, radio call in show? Did you know Utahraptor abused the word &quot;very&quot; in all his essays?</line>
				<line>Radio Host: I&apos;ve told you: this isn&apos;t an advice show! It&apos;s a show about RVs.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I like it when commercials license pop songs and then make up their own product centric lyrics.  It&apos;s a window into an alternate corporate-controlled universe!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: An alternate corporate controlled universe where all songwriters have brain damage?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The lyrics are always so terrible and the songs entirely arbitrary.  It&apos;s like - it&apos;s like they license &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; and then have some Elton John sound-alike singing &quot;Goodbye, Norma Jeane / Did you ever / Use Duracell / They make some fine batteries / On this we all should dwell&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Hah!  You know, I&apos;d watch that commercial.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Man, who hasn&apos;t written a story about a Man With A Problem for a while? Is it me?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m pretty sure the answer is &quot;YES!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So my new story will be about a man whose problem is he weeps all the time. He&apos;s not sad, his eyes just produce water like it&apos;s going out of style. And he tells everyone that it&apos;s just a biological thing and he&apos;s very happy to see them, but they all suspect he&apos;s sad. They say &quot;Are you alright?&quot; and he says &quot;YES dammit I just got leaky eyes.&quot; Then he locks his weeping eyes with them and says &quot;What&apos;s for dinner?&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It sounds like he&apos;s a pretty unsettling character!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No man, he&apos;s nice! He just weeps all the time.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m going to use it to explore PREJUDICE. What&apos;s it like to be a man of tears in a world where most men don&apos;t even like to cry at weddings? He faces a lot of preconceptions.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How does he deal with it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sometimes, in his most private moments - the tears are real.</line>
				<line>Story Quote: The airline had a strict &quot;no crybabies&quot; policy, and wouldn&apos;t let him board, no matter how he protested. Prejudice. He pointed at his eyes. &quot;See these? These are tears of PITY.&quot; But as he stormed out of the terminal, he knew that they were really tears of frustration, mixed with the standard tears he always produced.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: There&apos;s TONS of horrible diseases that sound like they&apos;re just made up by somebody, but actually do exist. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, in which connective tissue becomes bone, freezing a person in place! The Capgras delusion, in which loved ones appear to be replaced by identical imposters! And these are just the two I know about. </line>

				<line>T-Rex: Man, Alzheimer&apos;s? I mean, I know this disease has always been an issue for me, but it&apos;s so terrible. And honestly, it sounds like something out of bad fiction. It&apos;s ridiculous on the same level as &quot;always cries&quot;. It shouldn&apos;t happen.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I don&apos;t know what to tell you, man!</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  This is basically what it sounds like:  fatal insomnia.  First you have trouble sleeping, then you can&apos;t sleep at all, then you go demented and then you die.  </line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus:  Isn&apos;t that an inherited disease?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor:  But you can&apos;t catch an inherited disease.  You&apos;re just egging on hypochondriacs!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Man, they could inherit it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  The gene required for it has been found in, what, less than 30 families WORLDWIDE?  They&apos;re more likely to be struck by lightning, or hit by a car, or, I don&apos;t know, punched by a sheep or something.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Sheep can&apos;t punch.</line>

And the worst is when stories end on these significant Dreams, because in my mind, I&apos;m thinking &quot;This is ridiculous; when will we get back to the real story?

If you want to show that a character is tough, name him Genghis II.  If your character is this big lover guy who has fallen for, um, a 14-year-old, call him &quot;Romeo IV&quot;!  Hey presto!

				<line>T-Rex: The problem with Superman, and Spider-Man, AND Batman, and pretty much every other superhero, is that their stories don&apos;t have ends. They&apos;re all stuck in the same productive age range, 20-30 years old, and it&apos;s easy to see why!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Companies don&apos;t want their most popular characters dying of old age!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But the result is that their stories don&apos;t have ENDS. We don&apos;t know how Batman deals with a failing body and the rigours of old age, how Spider-Man reacts when Mary Jane loses her looks. I mean, we DO, because sometimes out-of-continuity stories explore this, but they&apos;re never for real - they don&apos;t count! Bats is always 30 again in the next story. It&apos;s like David fights Goliath, but they keep fighting every few issues for 50 years, and you never see how it ends.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You know, there are a lot of interesting parallels here with soap operas!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How so?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Soaps have long-running narratives, but characters die all the time. The difference is soaps focus on PREMISE rather than individuals, so they&apos;re not killing a cash cow when someone dies. They just bring in someone new!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So Batman dies, and the book focuses on his butler Alfred working for Spider-Man instead!</line>
				<line>[[T-Rex&apos;s thought bubble:</line>
				<line>Alfred: Sir, I am old and conservative. You can&apos;t expect me to &quot;loosen up&quot; overnight.</line>
				<line>Spider-Man: Alfred, I&apos;m young and liberal! I don&apos;t like your &quot;rules&quot;!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Ah, the age-old debate! Horses are okay.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you don&apos;t have any trains around, that is!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Horses eat grass. Trains are huge multi-ton machines that GET THINGS DONE. And then when you think trains are as great as it gets, you discover maglev trains! These are literal HOVERTRAINS that wrote in their diaries, &quot;Screw it, diary! I&apos;m just gonna go as fast as I can from now on!!&quot; and then they go 581 km/h like it&apos;s no big deal. NICE. Horses eat grass, and SOMETIMES, hop over buckets.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I guess the old stereotype of boys liking trains is true!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Come on, that&apos;s dumb!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I like trains because they&apos;re big complicated machines that NOT ONLY get folks places quickly, but also, threaten maidens tied to the tracks by mustachio-twirling villains. If horses could do that I would like horses too. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m pretty sure horses CAN do that. </line>
				<line>T-Rex: WELL THEN. I GUESS I&apos;M A FAN OF HORSES.</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER:</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m thinking, maybe I have no business writing romantical-like stories?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve got CHARACTERS but no spark.  They&apos;re not falling in love with each other!  They&apos;re staring at each other across open plains in the sunset, but when they finally meet up they shake hands cordially. THEN, after a lengthy silence, they inquire about the weather.  How do people friggin&apos; fall in love!?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Physical attractiveness is a good start!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I tried that!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I ended up with EROTICA, Utahraptor.  And I felt very off sitting there, writing about two imaginary people THAT I MADE UP having sex with each other.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Maybe try making them celibate?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Then there can&apos;t be sexy times at all.  That&apos;s not a bad idea!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, I am writing ROMANCE here.  No sex!</line>

		<title>i started this comic with a ghost/android dichotomy, before realizing that zombies fit better. androids are artificial bodies with artificial souls, and i guess we are all very concerned with whether or not the sheep they dream of are electric?</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for assuming that there&apos;s such thing as a soul!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Assumption: assumed!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And given this assumption, and the assumption that people care about exploring the idea of a soul, we can easily cast ghosts and zombies as the investigation of the soul-having experience that they are. For what are ghosts, but souls without a body? And what are zombies, but bodies without a soul?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In summary and in conclusion, ghosts and zombies allow us to explore the intricacies of soul (and body!) ownership.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So why are both these &quot;explorations of the soul&quot; found in horror stories?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s easy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: As people with bodies AND assumed souls, we find the idea of divorcing one from the other terrifying; therefore, the only way we can explore the consequences of these is through the lens of horror. Tada!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Honestly, I think your theory is a little pat. It doesn&apos;t consider all possibilities!</line>
				<line>Narrator: A FEW DAYS LATER, T-REX MEETS A ZOMBIE GHOST!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor, you were right!! I met a zombie ghost! He wanted to eat brains but his teeth passed right through brains!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Oh yeah?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Leave it to me to totally solve your emotional problems!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: There are many kinds of grief, so I&apos;ve focused on a particular flavour. When, say, a big meteor hits a dude square on the head and kills him, that&apos;s sad. HOWEVER, at the same time, it&apos;s also extremely amazing and awesome. It can be hard to reconcile these two, conflicting, emotions.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So what&apos;s your solution?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I propose a new word!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Have you noticed how that&apos;s your solution to every problem?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And have you noticed how it ALWAYS WORKS?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Today I propose a word meaning &quot;extremely sad, but also extremely amazing&quot;. It can be hard to pull off that emotion; you don&apos;t want people thinking you&apos;re TOO into how amazing it was. But if you say, &quot;I&apos;m very [my new word] right now&quot;, everyone understands! Grief has become easier to navigate!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I call my new word &quot;sawesome&quot;!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Sawesome.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Like sad and awesome?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: A bunch of us were hanging out in a house, some went outside, and then a nuclear bomb was dropped in the distance and we could see a mushroom cloud in the sky. I ran to the door to close it and pressed up against it as the windows in the house blew inward and radioactive dust covered us all. THEN, after it was quier and we ventured outside, I ran into my friends who surved, but we all agreed we&apos;d had too much radiation and wouldn&apos;t make it. It was really realistic!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Sounds like a pretty standard nightmare, my friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know! I was stoked!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But then these - stupid atomic zombies showed up? And they started zapping us with cheap-ass lightning bolts coming otu of thier eyes? It was super dumb, Urahraptor. It was that cheap 60s lightning where they just draw it directly on the film</line>
				<line>T-Rex and Utahraptor: Zombies don&apos;t even have lightning powers!</line>

I wish I had something to distract me. I bet if I&apos;d had sex, then I could think about sex, and that would be distracting. Hey! I should have sex! It&apos;ll make visits to the dentist easier.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: But WHAT IF he recognized that and let those people be free?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Exactly! Yes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Okay, but that&apos;s not fascism. Fascism is authoritarian and includes these ideas of unity and purity and stuff like that. It&apos;s a sort of xenophobic culty nationalism?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Well, Dromiceiomimus, that IS an interesting question!  A few years ago I would have said &quot;none&quot;, but now I&apos;m not so sure!  In a way, our bodies do affect who we are: if you&apos;ve got a strong body, you can be a different person than someone in a weaker body.  Trivially, a weak-bodied person wouldn&apos;t make a good bully!</line>

Bodies affect the life experiences possible, and therefore personality!  And while you&apos;re questioning my premise of &quot;nature over nurture&quot; I&apos;ll clarify that I&apos;m simply saying that someone in a weak body can&apos;t be a very effective bully!</line>

				<line>Narrator: PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENTS: WHAT&apos;S THE DEAL</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What gets me is the whole conflict in them: the position of &quot;I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you&quot;, with the caveat of &quot;Oh, baby, but just in case&quot;. I understand on a PRACTICAL level about how prenups are - practical, but on the level of love, I don&apos;t see how you&apos;re allowd to hedge your bets when it comes to marriage! I thought marriage was the ultimate expression of love.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And you see prenups as being the ultimate expression of love*.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s it exactly! Love with an asterisk.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, honestly, T-Rex, I think that it&apos;s INCREDIBLY presumptuous of you to say that.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know. I know! That&apos;s what bothers me about it! Who am I to comment on someone else&apos;s marriage? And yet, I feel compelled to comment on tons of someone else&apos;s marriages!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hey Mom! You know about the prenup you got when you and dad got married?</line>
				<line>Mom: Yes, honey?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I, um -</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Maybe I have been too hard on prenups. In a sense, they&apos;re sort of a Love Validater, right?</line>
				<line>Narrator: PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENTS: WELL, MAYBE THIS IS THE DEAL</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Because if you have a prenup that says, &quot;Wow, NOBODY&apos;S getting rich off this marriage&quot;, then it&apos;s clear that nobody&apos;s getting married for the money. The only reason left is love!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Or loneliness.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Or love! The prenup is a way of announcing AND VERIFYING that you love them for Who They Are, not for what they&apos;ve got in their pants! In their wallet in their pants. It was a great metaphor, Dromiceiomimus.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You know, Judaism has long had the &quot;ketubah&quot;, which is basically a prenup!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Really!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yep! It specifies divorce penalties but ALSO marital vows, and is hung up in the house. Prenups can mean a lot of different things to people!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh! Maybe the best way to learn about prenups is to get one. Oh my gosh, Utahraptor!! Let&apos;s get a &quot;friendship prenup&quot;!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hah! What?</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER, T-REX HAS COMPLETED HIS PRENUP! WHAT&apos;S IT SAY, T-REX?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It says &quot;Utahraptor! Don&apos;t steal my comics, UTAHRAPTOR.&quot; Then there&apos;s a drawing of him stealing my comics, with an x through it!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I didn&apos;t know I had a sliding two-day death window then! People can go WEEKS without food! Months! Two days without water is ridiculous.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Too. Friggin&apos;. Fragile!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m a big guy, so I eat a lot - WHICH IS FINE, except that it increases the chance that I starve to death! And if I&apos;m smaller I eat less, but I also face jerks trying to eat me! And if I&apos;m a single cell, nobody&apos;s going out of their way to eat me, but I can die if the host I&apos;m in dies or the stream drives up or whatever.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Man, that too!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In summary, life is too fragile and I describe that as &quot;sucks ahoy&quot;!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Maybe you should give up your ego here, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: While individuals may be fragile, species can survive a very long time! Why not see individual lives as single cells in the species: A multi-cellular multi-generational organism?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Um, because that&apos;s a metaphor that doesn&apos;t stop me from being food poisoned to death??</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER, IN COURT!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Your honour, if I steal, I get a few years in jail. If I murder, I get a LIFETIME in jail. But if I forget to eat for a few days or breathe for a few minutes, I DIE FOREVER?</line>

				<line>Narrator: T-REX HAS WRITTEN A STORY ABOUT A DOG THAT GETS SUPER POWERS!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s awesome! It was about a dog who didn&apos;t have super powers, and then one day, he got some super powers.</line>
				<line>Narrator: BUT THERE IS A DOWNSIDE:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Now everyone thinks MY dog has super powers!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t know at what point we all decided that authors aren&apos;t allowed to just make things up anymore, but it&apos;s totally what&apos;s happened to me! Somehow our fictions have all become real, and &quot;write what you know&quot; is the only creative option.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: People actually think your dog has super powers?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, they think he&apos;s so great he INSPIRED the super powers. He&apos;s actually just - really angry?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But that&apos;s the thing! Even if I write about something implausible, folks assume there&apos;s a real-life inspiration!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Come on, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: A lot of your previous stories WERE autobiographical. &quot;My Tiring Day&quot;? &quot;A Story About Me (At The End I Sit Down and Write The Book You&apos;re Now Reading)&quot;? If I were you, I&apos;d write my next book such that if people DID assume it was about me, it would be flattering.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes! Like &quot;The Day I Was EXTRA Nice To The Homeless&quot;!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Nobody can argue with that!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In my story there&apos;s a new Lolita, and she&apos;s thirty, and she goes out with a man who&apos;s also thirty and from a similar economic and social background! They get married and have some okay times. Years later, all the characters die of old age!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: It seems a bit - conservative!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I could make some changes! But did you notice how everyone was clearly of the age of majority though?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: T-Rex, your new book is basically terrible!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: *gasp*</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m serious! The &quot;new Lolita&quot; has nothing to do with the old one, and nothing interesting happens except when &quot;LoHEta&quot; shows up, explains that he&apos;s the new manly male Lolita, and then leaves the narrative entirely.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He shows up again in the epilogue! Utahraptor! You didn&apos;t even finish my book!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: At the end, Loheta addresses the reader directly and explains that if you replace &quot;she&quot; with &quot;he&quot; and &quot;hers&quot; with &quot;definitely his&quot; in the ORIGINAL Lolita, you can read all about his adventures!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It hurts!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And you can&apos;t turn it off. It&apos;s like a phone that won&apos;t stop ringing whenever I&apos;m hurt, and when I answer it, it&apos;s always friggin&apos; Pain calling and he won&apos;t get off the line. I say &quot;Yeah, I get it Pain, I stubbed my toe.&quot; and he says &quot;Yeah, it still hurts like a bitch. Can I say bitch? It really hurts, T-Rex&quot;, and I say &quot;Look, Pain. I know.&quot; and he stays on the line and I say &quot;Pain, you&apos;ve gotta find other people to call. You&apos;ve got to get other hobbies.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;d prefer looking down and seeing that my toe is stubbed to, um, EXCRUCIATING PAIN.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So you want leprosy.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Uh NO, I didn&apos;t say I want my LIMBS to fall off. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Leprosy doesn&apos;t make your limbs fall off!! You lose SENSATION in your body, so you can do things like accidentally crush your fingers and not notice. Hey, how&apos;s the centuries-old prejudice over there? Pretty uninformed? Pretty BIASED?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor! You were totally a jerk to me just now! And if you&apos;re hoping I&apos;m going to shout after you that &quot;Now I wish my HEART couldn&apos;t feel pain&quot;, I&apos;m not!</line>

		<title>how do we know when and how words changed pronunciation, if they weren&apos;t written down? well sir, we look at sucky rhymes in poems and presume they used to work, and also at books written during the shift complaining how kids today keep talkin&apos; wrong</title>

				<line>T-Rex: In the 15th and 16th centuries, spoken English changed dramatically, with vowels changing pronunciation and moving upwards in the mouth. Before it, we all sounded like ye olde-fashioned chumps. Afterwards, we all sounded hip and modern!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It was a century of kids outcooling their parents!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Before, &quot;boots&quot; was pronounced &quot;boats&quot;, and &quot;feet&quot; like &quot;fate&quot;. PRETTY OLD FASHIONED, dudes! But what&apos;s amazing is that the printing press was invented just before this started, and it was at this point that the spellings of words really got fixed. That&apos;s why English has so many oddly-spelt words! They show the pronunciation of words as they were, just before we underwent the Great Vowel Shift and decided to, you know, say everything differently.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And nobody knows why it happened!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know! It&apos;s so amazing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Linguists are like, &quot;Maybe immigration from the Black Death caused regional accents to be absorbed?&quot; and then another says, &quot;Maybe the English wanted to distinguish their language from the hated French?&quot; and then they both shrug at each other!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I don&apos;t think&quot;#8212;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I saw it!!</line>
				<line>Narrator: 15TH CENTURY ENGLAND</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hey peasants! Tell all your friends to pronounce &quot;boner&quot; like &quot;bone-air&quot;, okay? It&apos;ll make the future HILARIOUS.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so Herostratus burned down the Temple of Artemis. But what happened to the other wonders of the World? My friends, I ask a bold question: indeed, the boldest. I ask the question shied away from by the greatest minds of our age: </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Isn&apos;t it true that they were ALL destroyed by Herostratus? </line>
				<line>Narrator: T-REX THE MAUSOLEUM AND HANGING GARDENS AND COLOSSUS AND LIGHTHOUSE WERE ALL DESTROYED BY EARTHQUAKES LEAVING THE STATUE OF ZEUS TO BURN DOWN AND THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA TO UM CONTINUE TO HANG AROUND</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Earthquakes, huh? Huh. I guess Herostratus wasn&apos;t actually a time-travelling, mustachio-twirling, World Wonder destroying villain. Ah well! That&apos;s why pencils have erasers, right? </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But T-Rex, what would you call earthquakes?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Natural disasters?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Insurance motivators? Uh, building complicaters? Domino frustraters? Wobbley Times U.S.A.? Um. . . Shakey Shakes Central? </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Couldn&apos;t you also call them. . . &quot;ACTS OF GOD&quot;? </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh my God! God is like Herostratus times -- um, five!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: FACT.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Wouldn&apos;t it be great if rhetoric had evolved in the same way? I could have this hyper-evolved speaking that could convince anyone to do whatever I say, as long as they didn&apos;t have similar rhetorical powers to match! Anyone not inured to my amazing powers of speechifying would be putty in my hands. &quot;Oh, T-Rex, I&apos;m not sure I should do this&quot; they&apos;d say, and then I&apos;d say &quot;Oh maybe you should though&quot; and they&apos;d be all, &quot;Awesome.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It would be a disaster for society!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Rude, my friend!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I meant if there was such an advance. Early language learners would acquire languages the best, so it would be a generation of toddlers convincing their parents that letting them poop their pants is sweet. If you don&apos;t see what&apos;s bad for society in that, well - enjoy pooping your pants!</line>
				<line>T-Rex (thinking): The word &apos;poop&apos; is cool: it&apos;s transitive, but only for &apos;pants&apos;. You can pee your pants too though. Maybe it&apos;s the noun &apos;pants&apos;? Further research certainly seems warranted.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: METAPHORICALLY.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So hey, time for an experiment where I am the subject! From now on I&apos;m going to listen to a new song repeatedly over each 3-month period. It&apos;ll become indelibly associated with who I am then, and this way when I want to remember what I felt like from July to September inclusive fifteen years ago, I can just listen to the same song again. It&apos;ll all come flooding back!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s - well, that&apos;s not a bad idea!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If it works, I can go further, also consigning smells and foods to certain periods in my life! I&apos;ll be an old man, looking up &quot;first marriage&quot; in my database, and then reaching for a record player and my first bite of Wensleydale in years.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: In conversations, speakers generally try to make helpful contributions, and listeners generally assume that this is the case! This is called the &quot;cooperative principle&quot;, and philosopher Paul Grice proposed it! He&apos;s dead now.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s useful because it allows inferred meanings!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We can be at a party and someone can say &quot;Where&apos;s Utahraptor?&quot; and I can say &quot;He&apos;s sick&quot; and they understand that he&apos;s not here BECAUSE he&apos;s sick. Inferred meaning! If they don&apos;t assume I&apos;m cooperating then I&apos;m just offering non-relevant information, on the same level as if I answered &quot;Utahraptor&apos;s got shufflepants.&quot; and then clarified &quot;They&apos;re pants that shuffle when he walks.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But maybe I&apos;m not at the party BECAUSE of my shufflepants!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: See?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The cooperative principle is so ingrained that even when I say non sequiturs, you&apos;re looking for a way to read it under the assumption I&apos;m cooperating.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So I should assume that you&apos;re a disingenuous and unhelpful jerk.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: So Paul Grice went on to clarify his cooperative principle, identifying four maxims describing how people generally communicate. He called these &quot;GRICEAN Maxims&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nice one, Paul Grice!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He&apos;s dead now. These maxims are pretty useful though! There&apos;s the Maxim of Quality (don&apos;t lie), the maxim of quantity (only say enough to make your point, no more or less), the Maxim of Relation (be relevant) and the Maxim of Manner (be clear, brief, and unambiguous). These are four different different ways we cooperate with each other when communicating!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And if I were to say &quot;I kissed him with my lips on the lips&quot;, that would be breaking Quantity!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And arguably Manner. But by breaking them, I look for a HIDDEN meaning indicated by the flouting of the maxim! &quot;What is so important about your and his lips?&quot; I might ask myself.</line>

Is this truly CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE that we will one day visit the distant past, and drop spark plugs in sediment while we&apos;re at it? I would argue &quot;Definitely, dudes!&quot;  I would argue that there can be no other explanation and I would argue that it&apos;s gonna be great.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It wasn&apos;t?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: In 1820 he sailed from the Mosquito Coast of Central America to England, with the news that one of the native kings there had given him 30,000 km2 of land! The land was incredibly fertile, the natives helpful, and he&apos;d already established an army, banks, civil service AND democracy there. You couldn&apos;t walk without tripping on the gold nuggets that littered the ground, and MacGregor was selling land grants at a very reasonable rate!!</line>

One settler even committed suicide after trading his life savings for passage. By the time a rescue boat was sent and returned to London, 180 of the 240 emigrants had DIED.</line>

				<line>Narrator: METHOD 2: ASK YOUR FRIENDS IF THEY HAVE ANY SEXY FRIENDS THEY COULD INTRODUCE YOU TO!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Guys! We totally need a new analogy for sex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The one we have now is BROKEN. Sex as hunger? Okay, it works with &quot;sexual appetite&quot; and it works in that you want sex, and then you have sex, and then you&apos;re like, man, that&apos;s all the sex *I* can handle, and then in a little while you start to get the munchies for sex again. But that&apos;s it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Sounds like a good analogy to me!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But it&apos;s totally not!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I can die if I don&apos;t get any food, but if I don&apos;t get any sex, then I just - keep on keepin&apos; on? Also if I&apos;m hungry, I can&apos;t lock myself in a room and satisfy my hunger with my own food that&apos;s BASICALLY almost as good as the genuine item.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Food that you produce yourself?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Food that the Catholic church really doesn&apos;t want you eat?</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So we all have to be excited on January 1st?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: You WANT your actions analyzed. You want it because if a third party analyzes them, not only does that suggest they&apos;re interesting, but it also gives them intrinsic meaning: there must be something there worthy of analysis! You never have to worry about living a meaningful life if there&apos;s someone else to find meaning for you.</line>

				<line>Narrator: Anyway she woke up as a totally tough dude, stepping on houses like they were toy Monopoly houses, like in the picture? Everyone liked her. But her female form was missing and eventually people thought that she was murdered! Nobody believed her that she was a dude now and they thought maybe HE (the girl) murdered her (herself). She went to jail and EVENTUALLY, she died in jail, from a terminal case of too much being...in jail.</line>

				<line>Utahraptor&apos;s comic: Tina Rex was a woman with a curse. Tina Rex was a woman with a very peculiar curse.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor&apos;s comic: Ever since she was six, Tina Rex knew that she was one day to wake up as a man!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor&apos;s comic: She had been given this curse by her stepmother, who hated her, and presumably men as well. The curse didn&apos;t scare Tina. Failing to meet monthly progress reports scared her, missing a checkpoint on her Five-Year Plan scared her, but being a man was like being a woman, she figured, only with more prostate exams. She smiled at her joke. Tina Rex woke up as a man on her 31st birthday.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So! Did you read my rewrite of your comic?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: IT WAS SO TERRIBLE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, listen, you&apos;re not allowed to rewrite my stories anymore. Prostate exam jokes? Seriously? I stopped reading it three panels in.</line>

				<line>T-Rex&apos;s comic: Tina is a woman who can Punch The Future. This means that she&apos;d punch somewhere, and then three weeks later you&apos;d walk over there and go &quot;Ow who punched me.&quot; One time she punched a monocle guy who said &quot;Ow, my crotch!&quot; and then he turned around and he said &quot;Ow, my bum!&quot; THE END?</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve always been reluctant to get a tattoo, because what if my tastes change? I don&apos;t want to be the guy at 50 with &quot;BETTY AND VERONICA 4 LYFE&quot; tattooed on my back. I mean, right now I kinda do, but I can see that changing in like two seconds.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But I&apos;ve come up with a solution!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The whole problem comes from the fact that tattoos can&apos;t be altered, but that&apos;s not true! For example, imagine I get a tattoo of a butterfly, and THEN, I realize I wish I&apos;d gotten a tattoo of a flexing guy with guns for eyes instead. All is not lost! I just get a tattoo of a flexing guy using his gun eyes to SHOOT the butterfly, and I&apos;m the coolest! I instantly become the coolest dude.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So each new tattoo shoots the old one, but what happens when you run out of space?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I acknowledge I have finite room on my body for &quot;the tats&quot;, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;m THAT indecisive. Anyway, once I have the Enterprise shooting Batman shooting gun eyes shooting a butterfly, I think I&apos;ll be happy. I just - I can&apos;t ever see regretting that.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Bingo is totally suboptimal and inefficient!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Check it out: replace the caller with a computer, and you make the bingo numbers get called like a billion times faster. Replace the bingo players with other computers, and you speed up the rate at which the game is played. Tie both these innovations together and you can play HUNDREDS of bingo games per second! ONCE AGAIN, something has been made orders of magnitude more efficient by simply replacing all life involved with cold and soulless bingo-playing machines.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But the fun thing of bingo is in dabbing the numbers, in building up suspense as the game progresses. You&apos;ve made it boring!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My new, hyper-efficient bingo is basically like putting in your money, pressing a button, and being informed whether or not you&apos;ve won.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Exactly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But that&apos;s what slot machines do, and people LINE UP to play them! OH SNAP! IS THIS ANOTHER ARGUMENT WON BY T-REX??</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It turns out there are some regions where my HyperBingo(tm) is played. Neat!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And it&apos;s all thanks to legal loopholes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: AS IT HAPPENS, in some areas gambling is heavily regulated, but bingo is a special case that isn&apos;t. And so companies have built electronic bingo machines, exactly as I envisioned! Whats more, some have used bingo as an engine to power other types of gambling, like poker and slot machines. The game plays a hidden bingo game, and if you get a bingo, your slots will ALWAYS come up as three cherries. It&apos;s nuts! Bingo&apos;s being used in ways GOD NEVER INTENDED.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But how do they translate bingo into poker? You have choice over what cards stay in your hand!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They CHEAT!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Say you got a quick bingo, and that translates into a royal flush. You&apos;re doomed to win! If you throw away all your cards, you&apos;re just gonna get dealt the same flush in a new suit. Even if you try to lose, the computer will step in and CHANGE YOUR CARDS, or just make you win the next game.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Insane!</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE FUTURE!</line>

Like if I lived millions of years ago, only I was a mutant with a fully-formed extra hand growing out of the base of my spine! If I was the only specimen from the time, we might conclude that EVERYONE had butt hands then, and that would be provably hilarious. Then I thought: maybe we&apos;re already doing this!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How do you figure?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, maybe we&apos;re doing the opposite!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe millions of years ago life was awesome and surreal, but only the boring specimens got preserved. Maybe the non-chumps knew to avoid river beds and tar pits! Maybe dragons don&apos;t fossilize.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus! Which creature goes on four feet in the morning, two feet at noon, and three feet in the evening?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Its a human, T-Rex. Babies crawl on all fours, then they walk around and then when they&apos;re old they use a cane. Come on, that riddle&apos;s from Ancient Greece. That riddle is so old-school, the techniques necessary for modern school construction won&apos;t be invented for two thousand years.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:Huh! People know the riddle of the Sphinx?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re surprised?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: T-Rex, it&apos;s most likely the oldest riddle on the planet. Without hyperbole, entire civilizations have risen and fallen since someone first came up with that riddle. IT predates PAPER.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well... Patrick Stewart liked it.</line>
				<line>Narrator: EARLIER:</line>
				<line>Patrick Stewart: T-Rex, your riddle spoke to me personally because I started today on four feet, managed to walk on two feet at noon, and now I&apos;m using three feet!</line>

		<title>i went to my cousin&apos;s wedding this weekend and it was lovely. there were no hookups AND my cousins and i snuck up onto the roof! thank you for inviting me to your wedding, ginny</title>

			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: T-REX HAS BEEN INVITED TO ANOTHER WEDDING.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes! I know what that means...</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ill-advised hookups!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s the wedding experience! You get some single people together who think life is a race, and then you convince them THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF WEDDING that the only way to avoid coming in dead last is to get married! The result: hookups!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hookups of the ill-advised nature!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Come on, T-Rex, that&apos;s just a stupid stereotype and lame soap opera trope!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Lame and SEXY</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I just think that if you go into this wedding evaluating all the guests by their hookup potential, it&apos;ll colour your wedding experience in a really weird way.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor, guess what?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m still totally gonna be on the lookout for bad hookups!!</line>
				<line>Narrator: AT THE WEDDING.</line>
				<line>Voice: So what are you thinking, baby? Yes or no?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Um, I&apos;m thinking... That a lot of my internal conflict and malaise comes from the tensions between the life I ACTUALLY want to live, and the stories I&apos;d love to be able to tell?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I am a man who, when he is at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, will restrict what he eats based on his peers. I don&apos;t know when to stop, so I rely on the verbal and non-verbal cues of my dining mates to tell me when I&apos;m full!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I call this condition &quot;Appetite Asperger&apos;s&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It is a hilarious AND excellent name because people with Appetite Asperger&apos;s analyze the behaviour of others while eating and come up with a ruleset for saying when they&apos;re full. Just like someone with real Asperger&apos;s! Only, instead of applying this to social interaction, I apply it exclusively to knowing when to say &quot;Wow, dudes, I&apos;m full! How about you guys, huh? Pretty full? Oh my gosh, me too!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I would&apos;ve thought you&apos;d call it &quot;T-Rex&apos;s condition&quot; or something!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: NORMALLY, I would have!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But I made a list and I&apos;ve already got like four or five T-Rex&apos;s conditions. Plus, Appetite Asperger&apos;s has assonance going for it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I suppose. I&apos;m still not comfortable with the name!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And I&apos;m STILL not comfortable with the full range of my sexuality, but we all have to make do!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  I&apos;ll never say!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  I&apos;ve read Greek myths, man!  I know you guys are all about SNEAKY TRICKS and IRONY and MORALITY TALES in which dudes get wicked punishment for BASICALLY no reason.  I don&apos;t want to be in any noun-based morality tales! Not unless the moral is &quot;T-Rex Is The Best, Holy Cow You Guys.&quot;</line>

				<line>Utahraptor:  And you&apos;re not giving it to him?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  I was accusing him of the whole &quot;ironic punishment&quot; Greek God thing.  But he&apos;s not so bad!  I give him a hard time sometimes.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Hey God!  You want my word?  Here it is!</line>

		<title>what movies did t-rex see that were so terrible? why, the same two movies that YOU hate the most! oh my god! t-rex is So Relatable!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Wow, that was a terrible movie. Definitely one of the top 50 worst films ever!</line>
				<line>God: T-REX THERE IS BARELY 100 YEARS OF FILM SO THAT&apos;S NOT SAYING MUCH</line>
				<line>God: A FILM 1000 YEARS FROM NOW BEING ON THAT LIST NOW THAT&apos;S SAYING SOMETHING</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ridiculous!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: There&apos;s still bad movies. Anyway, most &quot;Worst Book Ever&quot; lists have mainly modern entries despite THOUSANDS of years of book history.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Yeah, because most ancient texts are lost forever! I&apos;d bet less than 10% of movies are lost and I&apos;m sure more than that amount of text is gone.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How are you measuring volume? Sure ANCIENT books are lost, but we generate so much text today that it&apos;s probably a tiny percentage overall!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: you have to include web sites, emails, spam...</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re seriously comparing email to film?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Come on! If you&apos;re including spam as text, are you including webcams as film? What about security camera footage, stored and erased without ever being watched? And how are we defining worst? Personal taste? Objective value? Box office performance, ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION OF BOTH MONEY, POPULATION, AND BOX OFFICES?</line>
				<line>Narrator: ONE WEEK LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What a terrible movie THAT was. I&apos;d definitely rate it one of the Top 50 Worst Films Of All Time!*</line>

		<title>the pebble was actually found in an australopithecine cave, so it may have been discarded before the dude died, left behind, untouched and alone and forgotten for millions of years. QUESTION: IS THIS VERSION OF EVENTS MORE OR LESS MAUDLIN</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: So, SOMETIMES, archeologists find things that don&apos;t belong in their geological contexts: shells where there were no oceans, that sort of thing. And there&apos;s lots of explanations like &quot;maybe an animal ate it and pooped it out, GROSS.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But sometimes these objects are found with human remains!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And when that happens they call it a manuport: something that was carried by hand by ancient dead dudes. Manuports are neat because they show you what ancient dead dudes found interesting! And the most awesome manuport is the oldest one, called the Makapansgat pebble. It dates to 3 million years ago!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: There weren&apos;t humans around to carry it 3 million years ago, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But there were PROTOHUMANS. Australopithecines! And the Makapansgat pebble has this natural &quot;eye eye mouth&quot; face shape on it. A protohuman had enough curiosity and aesthetic sense, 3 MILLION YEARS AGO, to see the face in the rock, and thought it was special enough to carry around with him until he died.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think it&apos;s beautiful and amazing that millions of years later, another human being dug up the same pebble, recognized the same face, and maybe even for a moment, dreamed the same dreams.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You stepped on a human being back there.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s - um, that&apos;s beautiful too?</line>

				<line>Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS: IF YOU COULD LOSE ANY SENSE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Me sense of proprioception!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s the sense that lets you know where your body parts are at any given time!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And it&apos;s ALSO a sense that gets dulled when you drink, which is why you have trouble touching your nose with your eyes closed in such situations. You&apos;re forced to rely on proprioception, and with it dulled, you miss! You poke out your eye with your hand or whatever.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Proprioception!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And you really want to be CONSISTENTLY SURPRISED about where your limbs are when you can&apos;t see them?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You know what? I don&apos;t think you would! I think you ACTUALLY chose proprioception because it&apos;s not one of the classical five senses, and you wanted to be Mr. &quot;Look At Me Guys I Chose An Unexpected Answer&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, it&apos;s true! But I messed up. I&apos;d really prefer losing nociception: the sense of pain!</line>
				<line>Narrator: BUT THAT IS A LIE TOO!</line>
				<line>Voice: T-Rex, I&apos;m afraid this accident has robbed you of one of your senses: the sense of what&apos;s appropriate in a given social situation!</line>

				<line>Narrator: DINOSAUR COMICS ASKS: IF YOU COULD GAIN ANY SENSE, WHAT WOULD IT BE?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I could look around and say &quot;In ten minutes it&apos;s going to rain!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But then the downside is that if I saw a car accident, I&apos;d be duty bound to try to prevent it.  And PLUS, once word got out about my awesome power, whenever I was with my friends and they tripped or whatever, they&apos;d blame me!  They&apos;d sit on the ground rubbing their knee saying &quot;THANKS T-REX&quot; with ultimate sarcasm when THEY were the clumsy chumps!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, why wouldn&apos;t you warn us?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe my mouth was full!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe I was warning someone else to my left!  MAYBE RISK IS PART OF FREEDOM AND BY PROTECTING MY FRIENDS FROM ALL POSSIBLE DANGER I STUNT THEIR GROWTH AND BECOME THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO THEIR OWN SELF-REALIZATION??</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Also, maybe the guy tripping was HITLER.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s right, Utahraptor!  I&apos;ll say I&apos;m friends with Hitler to win an argument!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Time for a funny joke, everyone!  Alright?  Alright.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so this man gets into a car accident and wraps his car around a telephone pole!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And there&apos;s this passer-by who is, um, passing by, and he happens to see it.  He rushes over to the crumpled car and says &quot;Oh my God, are you okay??&quot; and the guy says &quot;Well, I get by!&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: ... I don&apos;t get it.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The driver misunderstands the question; he thinks it&apos;s about whether or not he makes enough money to &quot;get by&quot; in today&apos;s difficult world!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But nobody says &quot;Oh my God, are you okay??&quot; to mean &quot;Oh my God, do you have a sufficient salary??&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure they do!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: No they don&apos;t!  They lock eyes with you and say &quot;Are you doing alright?&quot; with a hand on your shoulder or something.  Honestly, this joke seems like it could have been funny at some point, but you telephone gamed it in your head and it doesn&apos;t make sense anymore.</line>
				<line>Narrator: EARLIER:</line>
				<line>Passerby: So he rushes over and puts a hand on the guy&apos;s shoulder and says &quot;Oh my God, are you okay?  Are you doing alright?&quot; and the guy says &quot;I make a comfortable living!&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It is common to imagine your life as a story, with yourself as a main character! It&apos;s a story with no real climax that always ends with you totally dead.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: However!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My issue is that STUFF happens to main characters: dramatic stuff! Stuff that&apos;s not always good. It would be fun to be a bit character, a guy who gets one or two lines and whose personality is encapsulated in a few words: &apos;likes boats&apos;, &apos;old and wise&apos;, or &apos;eats a lot and, therefore, can&apos;t control himself around food. When someone says, &quot;Where&apos;s the beef?&quot; he runs up and says, &quot;Did someone say BEEF?&quot; because that is definitely how people who like food act.&apos;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Then I was thinking, maybe I am that!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But you&apos;ve said WAY more than two lines,my friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, but it&apos;s Rosencratz and Guildenstern, right? I&apos;ve got my own life, but it only counts when I&apos;m around the main character. Everything else is forgotten!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: so who&apos;s the main character?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ...Dromiceiomimus?</line>
				<line>Narrator: MUCH LATER, OUTSIDE DROMICEIOMIMUS&apos;S HOUSE.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: And so modest, too!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: You know what?  It&apos;s still egotistical, and if you&apos;ve succeeded at everything you&apos;ve tried, you&apos;re not trying hard enough things.  Here, here&apos;s something to try: why don&apos;t you cure cancer?  And hey, why not come up with a clean, safe, cheap, efficient, powerful, renewable AND reliable energy source while you&apos;re at it?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I think we can all agree that as a popular culture shifts with time, there were some years that were great and there were some years that were way terrible.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:Everyone knows that the 1920s were awesome ultimate fun times (on account of flappers and swing music!), and everyone knows that the 1970s were a decade of bad decision after bad decision: a cacophony of just - really bad decisions.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I think that some folks like the 70s.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hilarious!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: However, I have studied the past 2000 years and come up with the DEFINITIVE CULTURAL low. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Really? 2000 years?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes, Utahraptor: I have gone all over 2000 years and found the global minimum: the exact day when North American, and indeed, world culture reached its, um, opposite of zenith. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Nadir.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes. And it&apos;s the day AFTER the film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was released: July 7th, 1994.</line>

				<line>Narrator: THE THUNDER-LIZARD&apos;S DAY OUT</line>
				<line>Narrator: STARRING THOS. REX, ESQ.</line>
				<line>Narrator: The morning dawned bright and clear as the thunder-lizard began his perambulation.</line>
				<line>Narrator: The neighbour-woman was outside tending her radishes. &quot;Good morning,&quot; said the thunder-lizard. &quot;Good morning!&quot; said the neighbour-woman, a different (and inferiour) species of thunder-lizard.</line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;I&apos;m so glad you&apos;ve come by,&quot; she said. &quot;I ordered this hat from the specialty thunder-lizard haberdashery, but it&apos;s the wrong size! It looks like it might fit you, though - would you care for it?&quot;</line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;Would I!&quot; beamed the thunder-lizard. What a morning!</line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;Ho, there,&quot; came a cry from across the boulevard. &quot;Quite a smashing hat you&apos;ve got there!&quot; It was the thunder-lizard&apos;s friend, another thunder-lizard.</line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;It&apos;s the latest in fashions for thunder-lizards,&quot; said the thunder-lizard. &quot;It fits my crown perfectly!&quot; </line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;Ah, but can it withstand a scissor-kick to the noggin?&quot; asked the friend. &quot;I&apos;ve just come from judo class and I&apos;m eager to share what I&apos;ve learnt.&quot; The idiotic nature of this idea went unnoticed by either party. </line>
				<line>Narrator: Twenty seconds later, the longstanding friendship was over. </line>

				<line>T-Rex: Think of how far we&apos;ve come in just the past one hundred years!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And the pace of innovation is only accelerating.  Consider that iPods from only five years ago are now LUDICROUSLY UNACCEPTABLE, when in history a person might own a single record player their entire lives!  It is certain that in the year 65,000,000 marvels dwarfing even branded consumer electronics await us.  What new and fundamental discoveries about the universe are ahead?  Will our personal holographic media players ALSO accept phone calls??</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I believe they may not!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Explain!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I mean only to suggest that the uninterrupted progress of the past century could in fact BE interrupted, perhaps by a planet-wide and biblically awesome catastrophe SO HUGE that intelligent life is forced to re-evolve from scratch.  In the year 65,000,000 we may just be catching up to where we are now!</line>

I&apos;ll arrive two hours early, stand perfectly still across the street, and peer into your window with binoculars. I&apos;ll ring the doorbell while pressing my eye up against the peephole. I&apos;ll ask you how your day was and whenever you use the pronoun &quot;I&quot; I&apos;ll suck my fingers. I will be only MODERATELY discreet about it. Happy Hallowe&apos;en!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: While riding my bike yesterday and making a TOTALLY LEGAL move from the side of the road into traffic so that I could make a left-hand turn, this car dude honked at me!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So I flipped him off. It was BICYCLE ROAD RAGE!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It was insane. I never get road rage, bicycle or otherwise, and I never flip anyone off! But here I was being all that I hate! I flipped him off without even looking behind, and THEN, after I flipped him off he honked at me again, two little ones, and I flipped him off again, two little ones. Then I turned left and got away!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Are you sure he was honking at you?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I am certain of it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But how are you sure he meant anything aggressive by it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What else could he have meant?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well most cars have one horn that only makes one tone, right? So the only paths for sentiment encoding are honk duration and count. Maybe one honk from that guy means &quot;Hey sexy!!&quot; and two short honks means &quot;Wait a minute! You&apos;re not so sexy!!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh!</line>
				<line>Narrator: A FEW WEEKS LATER, T-REX GETS HONKED AT AGAIN:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Excuse me, everyone? You saw what just happened! What do you think that driver meant to convey?</line>
				<line>Mom: That you&apos;re a very handsome, clever and successful young man!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Someone who doesn&apos;t vote is CLEARLY super chumpy.  But, ON THE OTHER HAND, someone totally uninformed who votes anyway is ultra chumps too!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: An interesting conundrum!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So let&apos;s take it to extremes: if voters were SO UNINFORMED that they were effectively voting randomly, then their noise would drown out the signal of informed voters.  So that&apos;s bad!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Agreed!  But on the other hand, perfect knowledge of every candidate&apos;s position on every issue isn&apos;t possible.  So there will always be UNDERinformed voters - it&apos;s just a matter of degree!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Agreed!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So let&apos;s just multiply everyone&apos;s vote by their informedness!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Making a less informed vote worth less?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!  That way the &quot;goodness&quot; of a voter will directly impact how much their vote is worth!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Wow.  T-Rex, your system only works if we can objectively measure informedness, which isn&apos;t going to happen.  Plus, replace &quot;goodness&quot; with &quot;ethnicity&quot; in your phrase and you&apos;re a super crazy racist!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: If Two accepts, they both take their money and go their separate ways.  But if Two rejects, NOBODY gets any money.  And the game is played only once, so there&apos;s no worry about reprisals.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So what&apos;s the problem?  Player Two should accept all the time - some money is better than none, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what&apos;s so interesting!  When there&apos;s really unfair offers (90/10, 99/1), some players reject them anyway.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay so in 1958 these two US Air Force planes were doing training exercises with a real nuclear bomb for some reason, and they crashed into each other! And one of the planes was so damaged that it had to jettison its bomb above a bay in Georgia!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: We&apos;re searching for a nuclear bomb!?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Serial number 47782, baby!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This bomb was missing its nuclear capsule though, T-Rex! It wouldn&apos;t explode.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw man! NEVERMIND.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, where you REALLY want to look is beneath the ice in Greenland. Another crash there had four nuclear weapons involved, but only debris from three was recovered. There was evidence the fourth - or parts of it - had been so heated by the resulting fire that it melted down through the ice. Serial number 78252!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: And it doesn&apos;t even have to be God! ANYTHING that comes out of nowhere and solves all the problems counts! An early example is in Macbeth, where Lady Macbeth is TOTALLY GUILTY over the murder she masterminded, but then she remembers her time machine!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What?</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: THE MYTH OF KING MIDAS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Midas was a king who was nice to a friend of the God of Wine, and so he gets a wish from the God of Wine! NICE! And so Midas wishes that everything he touched would turn to gold.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Instantly the ground he&apos;s standing on transforms into gold!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The gold change races across the planet&apos;s surface and down into the mantle like a shockwave, transmuting it instantly. In seconds, the Earth&apos;s iron-nickel core becomes pure non-ferrous gold, and the planet&apos;s magnetic field is lost. Unshielded from solar wind, every living creature begins to absorb desperately fatal levels of radiation. The soft gold of the planetary crust is unable to sustain the weight placed upon it, and begins to buckle and distort.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Midas watches in horror as his planet dies a golden death!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But not for long!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: He&apos;s soon overcome by the terrible sensation of drowning on dry land: any air that touches his lungs is being transmuted on contact into tiny flecks of gold. He suffocates and dies as his lungs fill with the formerly precious metal.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Air that touches his cooling body continues to transmute, and he&apos;s soon covered in a fine golden layer of ash.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The moral is not to make wishes like that, King Midas!!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: So gravity happens because matter bends spacetime and blah blah blah.  But dudes, I had a crazy idea!  What if instead of gravity being a property of matter, it was a property of the ENTIRE FRIGGIN&apos; UNIVERSE?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Have all minds within the sound of my voice been COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY BLOWN??</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So check it: the universe is suffused with tiny invisible particles that travel in equal intensity from all directions.  So if you were alone in the universe, you&apos;d be hit equally from all directions and nothing would happen.  But if there&apos;s a planet in front of you, then any particles coming from its direction are going to hit it instead and not you!  So you&apos;re no longer in balance, and particles coming from BEHIND you will push you towards the planet.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And YOU&apos;RE blocking a much smaller number of particles from hitting the planet, so it&apos;ll move a little towards you!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s a fun theory, but if you&apos;re absorbing particles all the time, shouldn&apos;t you be gaining mass?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No, because they&apos;re &quot;#8212; massless?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ah, so you&apos;d be absorbing energy then.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They&apos;re &quot;#8212; energyless as well?</line>
				<line>Narrator: SOON, T-REX FINDS OUT THAT HIS GRAVITATIONAL THEORY HAS ALREADY BEEN PROPOSED BACK IN THE YEAR 1690!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Forensic anthropologists want to study how bodies decompose in different circumstances! And so they go to their neighborhood BODY FARM, which is basically just a few acres of land surrounded by a fence and filled with DEAD AND DECOMPOSING BODIES. Some are out in the open, others are underwater or entombed or whatever! And scientists come and science up the joint, and I&apos;LL be the guy who holds a torch under his face and says &quot;Welcome to my farm of death and decay.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The winner is the person who guesses the closest number!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So let&apos;s say everyone else chose 100 - you&apos;d want to choose 66.67, because that&apos;s 2/3rds of 100. But the catch is you all choose your numbers at the same time and don&apos;t tell the other players.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So, 66.67 is really the ceiling - any number larger than that can&apos;t possibly win!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But I can assume all the other players know this too, and won&apos;t guess higher than 66.67.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So in that case I should choose 2/3rds of THAT, which is - 44.44?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: And this is the problem with vegetarians!! If a cow sasses me, I can say &quot;Oh yeah? Well guess what, wise guy?! I will use your flesh for digestive energy.&quot;  But vegetarians just take it!  And then cows have no idea who they can get away with sassing, and let&apos;s face it they&apos;re not the smartest pickles in the fountain, so they sass EVERYONE and then I end up eating a lot of beef.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s not that big a problem.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I find it doubtful that you&apos;ve ever revenged yourself on animals in such a way!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You haven&apos;t?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor, it&apos;s so SATISFYING.  You&apos;re like &quot;My feelings are hurt, but soon I&apos;ll be full of meat.  Wow, I feel better already!!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What, you hang around farms and wait for some imagined insult?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, you&apos;re coming with me and we&apos;re going to sneak onto a farm.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: &quot;T-Rex,&quot; she said &quot;I&apos;m in love with you.&quot;  She gazed into his eyes, smiling.  &quot;I thought differently about it, and it&apos;s DEFINITELY because you&apos;re so handsome and intelligent.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: T-Rex laughed!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  &quot;Baby,&quot; he replied, &quot;it&apos;s also because I am sexy and loveable and smart and manly and sexy.&quot;  She was nodding.  He paused, looked around, and then whispered, &quot;I put &apos;sexy&apos; in twice because I&apos;m - &quot; &quot; -twice as sexy&quot; she whispered back, the two of them whispering it together.  She knew that he was twice as sexy as a regular sexy man.  That was probably a good thing for their relationship, he decided.  Better that she know now, than be suprised down the road!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  Suddenly she threw up on T-Rex, over and over until he was drenched in digestive fluid!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  No!  That&apos;s not what happened!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Um - &quot;That&apos;s not what happened,&quot; she said, wiping her mouth.  T-Rex realized it wasn&apos;t vomit, it was -</line>

By only asking for peace, I&apos;m forcing my entire network of friends to try to get it for me! It turns negative consumerism into Positive World Change, PLUS, if anyone pulls it off I get to raise my hand in the new utopia and say &quot;Awesome! This was my idea.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: This has raised some pretty profound questions for me.  First off, it seems evident that I have finite space in my brain, and things are getting erased.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The problem is, I don&apos;t have any control - conscious at least - over what gets deleted and what stays.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And you&apos;re concerned because you don&apos;t know who you are if you can&apos;t even trust your memories, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Right. I&apos;d say a good part of who a person is comes from their experiences - but if they are forgotten, where does that leave the person?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I suppose this comes down to whether or not you believe there is some essential part of you, something more than the sum of your experiences.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: And I&apos;m told that when you hold your newborn child in your arms for the first time, this is a transcendental and joyous life-changing event. Sure, fine! I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU. But why are these pleasures just related to reproduction? Why can&apos;t I have the joy of having a child without actually HAVING to have the child?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s my understanding that children are really expensive, you guys!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I don&apos;t see what kind of shortcut, you&apos;re going for here!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Genetic Engineering! It&apos;s SO EASY.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: let&apos;s just replace the biological imperative to reproduce! Let&apos;s give ourselves the same joy and wonder from an egg sammich as we get from first holding our child in our arms! Let&apos;s make gum as deeply fulfilling as watching your child graduate top of the class, Dean&apos;s list, summa cum laude. Bubblegum flavour.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So your ideal future is one where everyone&apos;s weeping over their Whoppers with Cheese, and nobody&apos;s having sex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Who said anything about not having sex? The whole point is you can do both at the same time!</line>

But this isn&apos;t generosity, it&apos;s greed!  It&apos;s well-presented greed.

				<line>T-Rex: Maybe we&apos;ll insist that love can&apos;t be defined, that it&apos;s beyond the reach of rational thought, that we fall in and out of love in a way that is completely beyond our control. All we can do is hope for the best and hold on for the ride, because it&apos;s Cupid&apos;s arrow straight through the heart, striking anywhere at any time!

				<line>T-rex: So it turns out that there&apos;s different kinds of love.</line>
				<line>T-rex: I know! Who knew?</line>
				<line>T-rex: There&apos;s ROMANTIC LOVE, but there&apos;s also the love you feel for a family member, an activity, religious love, a sandwich, and so on. And we call all these &quot;love&quot;, which maybe is why people are so confused about it! What we need are DIFFERENT words for each of these feelings.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Like other languages!</line>
				<line>T-rex: Aw man! Other languages already stole my idea?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Long ago, actually! Ancient Greek had words for passionate love (eros), dispassionate love (philia), the love of family (storge), general affection (agape), and so on. Versions of these survive in modern Greek as well!</line>
				<line>T-rex: Aha, but still no sandwich love!</line>
				<line>Narrator: EVERY DAY EACH OF US SAYS THE DUMBEST THING WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT DAY.</line>
				<line>T-rex: Hey, maybe the ancient Greeks all died out and evolved into current Greeks PRECISELY BECAUSE they didn&apos;t have a word for &quot;sandwich love&quot;??</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  I am a fan of knowing things!  Generally, the more things you know, the better prepared you are for someone asking &quot;Hey, do you know all about 18th century literature?&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Because then if you know about 18th century literature you can punch them aside and say &quot;OBVIOUSLY!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  But it occurs to me there are situations where ignorance is bliss!  For example, imagine if you knew all about how the worst moment of your life would go down.  You&apos;d spend a bunch of your time saying &quot;Aw dang, that&apos;s STILL going to suck!&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus:  Or maybe you&apos;d say &quot;I&apos;m glad my current circumstances aren&apos;t as bad as THAT!&quot; or &quot;Now that THAT&apos;S over, things have nowhere to go but up!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  True.  Okay, but say you knew the BEST moment of your life!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  Something to look forward to!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Okay, but say it&apos;s passed, so it&apos;s all downhill from here on out.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  Still, maybe you&apos;ve got a bunch of tied-for-second moments, and I bet all those combined are better than one single best moment!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  FINE.</line>
				<line>God:  T-REX KNOWING EVERYTHING IS NOT ACTUALLY THAT GREAT</line>

And it&apos;s drifting in deep space!  The engines have overloaded and blown up.  This is all explained in the opening musical montage, set to &quot;Louie Louie&quot;!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: It&apos;s comedy?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Um, no!  It&apos;s science fiction DRAMA.  &quot;Louie Louie&quot; is just a really good song.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Yes.  He&apos;s yelling &quot;Status!&quot; and there&apos;s a dramatic strings version of &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; playing.  It&apos;s a very tense scene!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Most of Shakespeare&apos;s life is a mystery!  People spend their time reading his plays and saying &quot;Man, this guy has dudes sailing from cities that are days away from large bodies of water.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;He must not have known geography that well!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Therefore... he must not have travelled that much!  I HAVE UNCOVERED A FACT ABOUT SHAKESPEARE&apos;S LIFE!&quot;  and then they&apos;re happy.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But that&apos;s because there&apos;s not much we actually know about Shakespeare&apos;s life.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s exactly my point!  We&apos;re RECONSTRUCTING it from hints, subtext, deduction and innuendo from his works.  I CAN USE THIS.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In my own life!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ll write plays that HINT at how great I am, how smart and sexy and awesome everyone finds me.  Then I just excise every other mention of myself from history, and the plays are the only source left!  They&apos;re the only way to learn about the towering mind behind them, this Adonis of authors, this... T-Rex.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But what if your play sucks and nobody wants to know ANYTHING about its author?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Please.  My first play is called &quot;The Motorist Who Spewed Racial Epithets While Also Spewing Vomit&quot;!</line>

		<title>it&apos;s only plagiarism if you write &quot;plagiarism: the final frontier&quot; and then you have a li&apos;l footnote saying &quot;i totally wrote every word of that, SCREW GENE RODDENBERRY&quot;</title>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I think it would be a great idea to write a really convincing essay praising plagiarism, and have significant parts of it plagiarized. Hilarious!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Looks like this Thursday morning just got filled up!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ahem. Plagiarizing is the act of plagiarizing; taking someone&apos;s words or ideas as if they were your own! That&apos;s from the dictionary, Dromiceiomimus. I plagiarized it!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: At what point does plagiarism begin, though? When defining a word, especially in brief, it&apos;s possible you&apos;d hit on the exact same word structure as someone else. That&apos;s not plagiarism, that&apos;s just &quot;#8211;independent invention!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, and if you say &quot;I&apos;m hungry&quot;, you&apos;re not plagiarizing everyone who&apos;s said it before!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: FINE.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;How do I love plagiarism? Let me count the ways.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, there you&apos;re using a poem so famous I&apos;d argue it doesn&apos;t need citation. It&apos;s a reference! People will get it.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ah! You mean like &quot;Plagiarism: the final frontier&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Plagiarism is the sun&quot;?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Any machine that travels through time has to be a machine that travels through space as well! I&apos;ve been saying this for years.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Because dudes, the Earth is spinning on its axis!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And it&apos;s whipping around the sun, and the sun is rotating in the arm of a galaxy that&apos;s also whipping around the Universe. You go back in time without travelling through space, you&apos;re likely to find yourself alone in the vacuum, millions of kilometers behind the Earth you left a (relative) instant ago!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Perhaps! But this problem only comes up if you&apos;re not the centre of the Universe.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: If you&apos;re not the centre of the Universe, then you&apos;re perched on an Earth that&apos;s whipping through space, and sure, there&apos;s problems from that. But if you ARE the centre of the Universe, then everything&apos;s revolving around you! You can go through time without worry, because you&apos;ll always arrive right where you started.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, wow! This means that if we can travel through time, then we can also SCIENTIFICALLY PROVE whether of not someone is actually the centre of the Universe.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: There&apos;s nowhere to go but down!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve got no new frontiers to challenge! Do I quit while I&apos;m ahead? That seems like a waste of all effort. or do I power throgh and continue painting as my body begins to fail, trying to recall my earlier successes as my work inevitably declines, sliding towards self-parody?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think that&apos;s egotistical and false dichotomy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Explain!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Just because you&apos;ve conquered everything about painting TODAY doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ve also conquered everything about painting in the future. You&apos;re in privileged position of a master painter: from that high vantage point, maybe you can see where the medium can go next!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I have a confession, Utahraptor!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I was 10 the last I painted! And it was muscley dog doing the splits. And I&apos;m sure Leonardo could have painted it better. And I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;m talking about the Ninja Turtle there. </line>

				<line>T-Rex: Here are some things that are sad!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Abandoned puppies, and little birds with a wing in a cast. Aww!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And then you throw in an orphan with a crutch! And a little girl holding the limp string and rubbery plastic remains of her only birthday gift this year, a balloon with the words &quot;Happy Birthday Naseem!&quot; printed on it. The girl&apos;s name is Jenn.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: And the balloon wasn&apos;t filled with helium! It was filled with water.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Brackish, swampy water! And it was tossed to her without warning and now she&apos;s drenched.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And the water also drenched the orphan and puppies and birds!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: They&apos;re all drenched, lost in sorrow - a new kind of sorrow, a grief, a sadness so intense it could smother them. Dripping wet, staring at the ground, they weep. Eventually Jenn looks up and smiles as best she can, bravely, but it&apos;s so small, so fragile. She turns and walks away, her broken balloon dragging behind her.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A scientist runs up, explaining that dogs and birds can&apos;t cry! But, as she examines the animals she discovers that in addition to tear ducts, they have ALSO evolved the ability to experience sadness with an intensity previously unknown on the planet. THE END.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Joy has been distilled into a useful gaseous resource! And everyone&apos;s so happy that it&apos;s basically infinite. We all keep being joyous, and our balloons keep getting more full. When they pop, it&apos;s not with a bang, but rather with the intimate sound of a lover&apos;s sigh at the end of a rousing session of SEXUAL CONGRESS!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Attention, people who are hunting jobs! You are know as &quot;job hunters&quot; and guess what? I have some tips for you, my friends!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Tip number one is to have a good email address!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If I were an employer and I had two equally qualified candidates, but one resume came from colin@businesssuccessislifesuccess.com and the other resume came from colin@chumpstakingdumps.com, I know which one I&apos;d want to hire!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Is it colin@chumpstakingdumps.com?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It is without hesitation!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That business success jerk has the most obnoxious email address ever.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And the other guy doesn&apos;t?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No man! The other guy surveyed the field of resume email addresses and said, &quot;You know what? It can be done better.&quot; I&apos;m fascinated by him! Who is Colin? And furthermore, what of his Chumps, who it seems are presently Taking Dumps?? I don&apos;t know, but I want to offer him a job to find out!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: TWEETING.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, I get that you&apos;re using Twitter! SUPER. But I really don&apos;t get why we need a new verb for that.. All &quot;tweeting&quot; means is &quot;posting to Twitter&quot;: it&apos;s got the same meaning as &quot;post&quot;, except THIS verb can only be used in relation to a single corporate website. That&apos;s insane! Corporations invent nouns all the time, and I can accept that, but verbs? Really? Is updating Twitter SO DIFFERENT than updating any other website that we need a whole new word for it?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Man this is old news, Professor Curmudgeonly! You ever seen something escalate?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure have!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: OH DAMN &quot;ESCALATE&quot; IS A VERB MADE UP FROM &quot;ESCALATOR&quot;, WHICH WAS ITSELF A TRADEMARK! So now you can&apos;t escalate. And you also can&apos;t zip up your pants. Or go trampolining, roller-blading, or jetskiing. Or tase your enemies.</line>

		<title>now you never have to admit that you&apos;ve never committed any poems to memory! YOU JUST DID</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so I&apos;ve been down on poems in the past. I MAY have been heard to remark &quot;Guys, poetry bloetries.&quot; But I&apos;ve just discovered:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Poems likely predate the written word!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It makes sense when you think about it. Before writing, the only way to keep track of something is to memorize it! And if you&apos;re memorizing something in POEM form, then you can automatically incorporate structure to the language: say, rhyming couplets. And that structure gives you something to jog your memory if you forget! The result is that structured narrative poetry can be much easier to remember than just free verse.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So poems could be among the earliest, most practical forms of communication!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And this is why I feel bad! I didn&apos;t know that I was making fun of one of the Elder Gods of language! I thought I was making fun of &quot;The smelly dog who pooed / Has spied me in the nude&quot;.</line>

		<title>&quot;i&apos;ve saved $3.55 in my life. $3.55 in 80 years. :0&quot;</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Conceptual metaphors are those that allow us to understand one idea in terms of another! They inform the language we use when talking about all sorts of concepts, and are almost subconscious.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example: &quot;LIFE IS A JOURNEY&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: People use this metaphor all the time, all talkin&apos; about &quot;going places in life,&quot; &quot;getting a head start in life,&quot; &quot;being at a crossroads,&quot; and so on. It&apos;s so entrenched that to talk about life using another metaphor seems odd! For example, saying &quot;I&apos;ve saved $3.55 in life&quot; sounds weird, but only because I&apos;m using the much less popular &quot;LIFE IS A DISCOUNT STORE WITH SALES THAT CAN OCCASIONALLY BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF&quot; metaphor.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Are there other metaphors like this?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, tons!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Burning with desire and &quot;warming up to someone&quot;? That&apos;s &quot;AFFECTION IS HEAT.&quot; &quot;Falling behind&quot; at work before &quot;catching up&quot;? &quot;SCHEDULES ARE MOVING OBJECTS.&quot; &quot;You&apos;re in my way,&quot; &quot;Get out of my way,&quot; and, ARGUABLY, &quot;I&apos;ve lost my way&quot;? That&apos;s the classic &quot;DIRECTION IS A BUCKET THAT PEOPLE KEEP SNEAKING INTO.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In conclusion, cognitive linguists love conceptual metaphors because they allow us to describe direction as an intensely desirable giant bucket.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s true! You travel back in time to the 1200s and you say &quot;What color goes with St. Patrick?&quot; and they&apos;ll answer &quot;blue&quot;! Eventually. First you&apos;ll need to figure out how to communicate with the people there: their vowels will sound all crazy to your ears. Plus, assuming you&apos;re in an English speaking part of the world- and there were a lot fewer of them then- the language was way more Germanic than what you&apos;re used to.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You&apos;re right in the middle of Middle English, my friend!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And it was really fragmented back then!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The British will end up creating a Standard English just to ensure that government communication can be READ outside of London.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But not until the 1400s, so if you&apos;re in the 1200s and nobody understands you, you could always wander around, find another dialect group, and try again!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Man, I&apos;m not old! I do tons of stuff that&apos;s not old people stuff! Do old people knock back extremely sour gumballs like they were regular gumballs?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If they do, they&apos;re not doing it around me!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Do old people stomp on things in their way instead of walking slowly around them? Do old people solve their problems with their fists? I have never seen an elderly gentleman solve problems with his fists! </line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I&apos;ve never seen you solve problems with your fists either, actuall!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Then you must not&apos;ve been looking, Dromiceiomimus! My left fist is called &quot;Plan B&quot; because it solves so many problems!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And what&apos;s your right fist called?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Plan C!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s put into action in the event that Plan B fails. ONLY IT&apos;S NEVER BEEN USED BECAUSE PLAN B NEVER FAILS!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And this makes you not old.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep! I&apos;m young because MY body parts still have nicknames.</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER: REGRET</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ... Man, it would have been way funnier if I&apos;d nicknamed my WEINER &quot;Plan B&quot;! Every time someone said &quot;Let&apos;s take a close look at Plan B&quot;, I could&apos;ve laughed and laughed!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: If someone were to ask me what my favourite suffix is, I would answer them without hesitation: &quot;-cracy&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: IT TURNS ANYTHING INTO A GOVERNMENT.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you really like sandwiches, all you have to do is think &quot;sandwichocracy&quot;, and hey presto, your ideal system of government is right there! If you love yourself, an autocracy is what&apos;s perfect for you, mister! And et&apos;s say you love action figures.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: &quot;Actionfigureocracy&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: WHY THE HECK NOT??</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;d really choose &quot;-cracy&quot; over &quot;-tastic&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Any day, my friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You could say, &quot;Hey, imagine something awesometastic&quot; and I can say, &quot;Wait, imagine an awesomeocracy instead!&quot; and then everyone will imagine my thing instead because it&apos;s better. Plus, &quot;-cracy&quot; INCLUDES &quot;-tastic&quot;. All sandwichocracies are sandwichtastic, but not all things sandwichtastic are a sandwichocracy!</line>
				<line>God: T-REX WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THE UNIVERSE WAS JUST A TEST TO SEE IF &quot;SANDWICHOCRACY&quot; AND &quot;SANDWICHTASTIC&quot; WOULD EVER BE USED IN A SENTENCE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I would tell you it&apos;s been a rousing success!!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Let&apos;s say I decide to say a word only once in my ENTIRE life. That&apos;s a hapax legomenon!</line>
				<line>Narrator: HAPAX LEGOMENON</line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;just as cool as it sounds&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hapax legomenons are words that are only said once by someone! They&apos;re also words that only appear once a book, or even once in the ENTIRE RECORDS OF A LANGUAGE. Like &quot;gopherwood&quot;! It only shows up ONCE in both the Bible AND in the entire writtern record of Classical Hebrew. That&apos;s one heck of a hapax!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What does it mean?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nobody knows! It&apos;s a kind of wood? Probably?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s there because God&apos;s all &quot;NOAH BUILD AN ARK OUT OF GOPHERWOOD OKAY&quot; but now we&apos;re all, &quot;what? Um, maybe he meant cypress wood? Did somebody transcribe this friggin&apos; poorly?&quot; It&apos;s cool how unlikely we are to ever discover anything new about a hapax!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Its precise meaning will forever remain a mystery!</line>
				<line>God: T-REX GOPHERWOOD IS JUST WOOD THAT WAS PEED ON BY A GOPHER</line>
				<line>God: I CONFESS I FIND THE SCENT</line>
				<line>God: INTOXICATING</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s not that hard to be creative!  But sometimes when I come up with a joke, I find out it&apos;s already been invented in the past, and it&apos;s always by the same dead guy!  I now have a beef with this dead person.  You&apos;d best watch out...</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ...OSCAR WILDE!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Man, Oscar!  Here&apos;s a guy who&apos;s been taking the credit for TONS of great jokes that I would have come up with if he hadn&apos;t done so first.  Telling a border guard &quot;I have nothing to declare except my genius&quot;?  I TOTALLY WOULD&apos;VE COME UP WITH THAT IF IT HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN COME UP WITH.  &quot;I&apos;m not young enough to know everything&quot;?  THAT PROBABLY WOULD&apos;VE BEEN MY BON MOT.  Wilde&apos;s the most egregious preemptive plagiarizer of my funny jokes ever!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re not mad at Oscar Wilde, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Pretty sure I am, Utahraptor!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: No, you&apos;re mad at J. M. &quot;Peter Pan&quot; Barrie for the young one, and at some anonymous wag for the genius one - nobody&apos;s found a reliable link to Oscar for it.  He just gets the credit!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh.  Okay, I&apos;LL be the guy who&apos;s mad at all the UNWARRANTED credit Wilde gets, then.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: &quot;If with the literate I am/ Impelled to try an epigram,/ I never seek to take the credit; / We all assume that Oscar said it.&quot; - Dorothy Parker.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: FRIG.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: What doesn&apos;t kill you only makes you stronger!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Is that... medicine?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know it doesn&apos;t work in all cases, or maybe even MOST cases, but it works with vaccination, right? A weaker version of the disease teaches your body to fight the real deal.  So what I&apos;m wondering is if I ate something disgusting, does that, you know... level me up for some REALLY insanely disgusting things in the future?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You mean in terms of protection against disease, or in terms of adjusting your taste?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Attention, please, everyone! I&apos;ve done some reading about the brain and I discovered there&apos;s a part of it called the &quot;amygdala&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And the amygdala is responsible for FEAR RESPONSE!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is amazing! I had NO IDEA fear was localized to a single location. This opens up whole new avenues in the field of toughening up the very scareable: just open up their brain and remove their amygdala, and it&apos;s an instant fearectomy! They&apos;ll wake up from surgery, shake your hand, laugh in the face of danger, and then get business cards that say &quot;PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO EXPERIENCE FEAR&quot;.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s like solving a problem of high blood pressure by removing the heart, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Only analogously!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The amygdala doesn&apos;t just do fear, anyway: it&apos;s also responsible for long-term memory rentention! The more emotional the memory, the better it&apos;s stored. If you lose it you also lose the ability to learn from feelings!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah! NOT A PROBLEM. You know all I&apos;ve ever learnt from feelings?</line>
				<line>Narrator: ALL T-REX HAS EVER LEARNT FROM FEELINGS:</line>

			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: A MAN WALKS INTO A BAR explained</line>
				<line>T-Rex: many jokes begin with this line. It is called the &quot;set-up&quot;, and is analogous to establishing-shots in films or first paragraphs in essays.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It alerts the audience that what follows is likely to be a short story with a humorous climax!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What is the attraction to this structure of humor? Why are there so many jokes about men walking into bars?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Part of the attraction to this structure may be its possibilities: most anything can happen in a bar, especially if this bar is contained within the wild and wooly world of the verbal jest.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What about the joke, &quot;A man walks into a bar...ouch!&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Good question!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The joke assumes some sophistication on the part of the audience, an expectation gleamed from previous jokes that the bar is a drinking establishment.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Go on!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The &quot;ouch&quot; is startling. How could entering a bar hurt? It forces us to now re-evaluate our most basic assumptions.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We must ask ourselves, &quot;What if the bar were a bar proper, and by walking into it the man actually, physically walked into it?&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It is this confusion on the part of the listener that is responsible for the humor!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, but I didn&apos;t know &quot;Horses&quot; was an actual option! We live in a world where &quot;Horses&quot; is a real last name. How&apos;&apos;d I miss that one?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Taste is kind of baloney, you guys!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Delicious food is delicious, no matter how good or bad it is for me! Wouldn&apos;t it be so much better if how good a food tasted to me depended on how good the food was FOR me? Chocolate would taste worse the more I gorge on it, until I stopped out of disgust. And if I haven&apos;t had any vitamin A in a while, carrots would taste like friggin&apos; MANNA.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But then every time you&apos;d eat something, you&apos;d have no idea how it&apos;ll taste!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But it&apos;s a feedback loop: your own body is training you on what it needs through the medium of taste! Eventually you&apos;d know your own nutritional needs by PURE INTUITION.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It is kind of baloney that poison can b e delicious.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It was SO good!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And then they took the cereal off the market and this little kid could never find it again. Okay, it was me. I was the kid. I looked and looked and was convinced all the grocery stores were hiding it somewhere. But it was gone, and that one box of the cereal was all I ever had. I never stopped looking, however, and yesterday I found it - under a different name, but with all the same ingredients!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And? How was it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: WAY too sweet, Utahraptor.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It wasn&apos;t too my taste at ALL. And the kicker is I remembered it as being even sweeter! I realized that my tastes had changed long ago - that I&apos;d never again be able to enjoy the cereal I remembered so vividly. I&apos;d been chasing a dream that had somehow become impossible when I wasn&apos;t looking.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And for who? For a child I knew decades ago, a child who had long since faded into adulthood - into me. Anyway bottom line I had to see food go to waste so I poured the rest through your mail slot.</line>

				<line>Narrator: THE MYTH OF ICARUS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Icarus and his dad were imprisoned on an island with water patrols, so they couldn&apos;t escape by boat. But they still wanted to escape anyway, so they made wings out of wax and feathers and flew away.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Pretty clever, boys!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And while they were flying, his dad warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun, because the wax in his wings would melt and he&apos;d fall to his death! Icarus said &quot;Frig, is this symbolic of how we mortals should not aspire to usurp the power of the Gods? Is this an allegory showing the limits and folly of earthly invention? Because we just invented heavier-than-air flight out of WAX and FEATHERS, Dad. I think maybe the Gods won&apos;t mind.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And then Icarus flew straight up!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: As high as he could!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And as saying that things get hotter the higher up you get is incredibly naive (how come mountain tops aren&apos;t sweltering?), Icarus was fine. Temperature actually DECREASES as you go up the troposphere, and there&apos;s no way Icarus could fly up to the thermosphere, where things DO get hot, because there&apos;s just not enough air.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So Icarus had a great time flying and when he finally landed his dad said &quot;Wow, I sure was wrong&quot;, and they spent the rest of their lives flying just as close to the sun as their clever mechanical wings would take them. Kids! The moral is never listen to your elders!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Plus, if people saw me on the street they could say &quot;Hey, it&apos;s all Well and Good!&quot;, except that they wouldn&apos;t actually say the &quot;all&quot;, so it would just be &quot;Hey, it&apos;s Well and Good&quot;, which doesn&apos;t really work.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Digging a ditch is never as fun piling things onto a small ridge by the side of the road.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: When you get a tattoo, you&apos;re getting pictures or words - or both!  - written right onto your flesh permanently, assuming you don&apos;t remove or alter them.  And pictures or words are really just communication, and communication is really just ideas in transit, right?  So a tattoo is really just Present You telling Future You &quot;Look, this was important to me, so um, I kinda made sure you&apos;re not going to forget it.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s an insurance policy for personal development?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: He ALSO stole form the rich and gave to the poor!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He made tree forts AND crimes.  And the Sheriff of Nottingham didn&apos;t like this one bit!  He was a good sheriff who believed in the rule of law and the court system.  He took his job and his sheriff school degree very seriously and always did his best.  He said, &quot;Not only will I arrest Robin Hood for &apos;robbin&apos; from rich people, but I will also sword fight him if he wants, and I will marry his girlfriend. I really hope that will teach him to obey the law!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Did it work?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: HECK NO.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Robin&apos;s girlfriend didn&apos;t want to marry the Sheriff, and then to make matters worse, Robin Hood killed the Sheriff and his men!  The Sheriff&apos;s last words were &quot;I&apos;m sorry I could never convince you, Robin, to work for positive change from within the system.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay anyway!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Let&apos;s say you&apos;ve got a problem with your partner: THAT SUCKS.  But you two should talk about it, and if you can&apos;t reach a solution, resolution or compromise that&apos;s mutually satisfying and that you both believe will be acceptably implemented, then you should break up!  It is a fail-proof algorithm for relationship satisfaction.  Tada!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So the relationship now hangs in the balance of every disagreement, no matter how small!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Of course not!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: OBVIOUSLY, if you value the relationship and it&apos;s potential future more than the sum of this problem plus all previous problems, then you should stay together!  I folded that into &quot;mutually satisfying&quot;.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: A narrative hook is when you introduce a story with something incredible so your audience will keep reading!  It happens when you&apos;re told that in this comic... SPIDER-MAN!  WILL!!  DIE!!!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique:</line>
				<line>Narrator: NARRATIVE HOOK</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Setting, themes, and basically anything else can ALSO be used as a narrative hook, but they&apos;re all pale imitations of Spider-Man&apos;s death being announced on the first friggin&apos; page!  Compare and contrast &quot;As the bullet sped towards his eye, Neil wryly observed that things probably couldn&apos;t get any worse!&quot; with &quot;As the bullet sped towards his eye, Neil suddenly remembered that by the end of the chapter, Spider-Man!  Will!!  Die!!!  The bullet sped closer.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, but Spider-Man never dies!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what makes it such a great hook!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We know that, WORST CASE, Spider-Man will show up in the next issue and say &quot;Hey did anyone miss me?  I thought I was dead, but then I remembered I wasn&apos;t!&quot;  And yet we keep coming back for more!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And that&apos;s great?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!  It&apos;s why the first sentence of ANY BOOK is improved by adding Spider-Man.</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Some people think pornography is bad, since when they see it they get offended and say &quot;That&apos;s way too explicit. SHEESH!&quot; With that in mind, I&apos;ve come up with something special: pornography for them! But it&apos;s also -</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Pornography for everyone!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Obviously, you can&apos;t control how explicit images are, since they&apos;re set. But, you CAN control how explicit text it, since any images there are imagined by the reader. So all you need to do is craft sexy fiction that relies on the reader generating any eroticism in the scene! That way, they only have themselves to blame if they imagine something they think is way too sexy.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;d like to see an example!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Of course!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Pat and Alex had some sort of relationship. One time they were expressing it physically - in a remarkable way! Their location: erotic. Upon seeing it a third party would likely say &quot;How are they... wow. Just - wow.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s not very erotic.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You criticize only your own imagination!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Did you even NOTICE how I used names that work for both men and women? It is QUANTUM EROTICA, at once straight, lesbian, gay and other, which only collapses into one sexuality upon being observed by the reader!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: And it has to have the caps like that too. Ooh! Or it could read &quot;In today&apos;s obituary we focus on T-Rex, one of the greatest men to ever rip open his shirt by flexing his pectoral muscles, and one of the only men to save the city by doing so.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: You seem to be big on going out by saving people!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It ensures a good write up, Dromiceiomimus!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re not a fan of &quot;T-Rex died today after being really old for a while&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Man, that&apos;s the worst!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If I&apos;ve got to die, I&apos;d rather it&apos;s from being too awesome than being too old, you know? I want my obit to tell a story that doesn&apos;t end with &quot;and then his body decined until it stopped working entirely, the end.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I can see the appeal in having a good solid sending!</line>
				<line>God: SO UM</line>
				<line>God: YOU WOULDN&quot;T BE HAPPY IF IT READS &quot;T-REX DIED THE WAY HE LIVED: ON IMPACT&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No no, that one is entirely great too!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Time for me to start counting my friggin&apos; calories!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, do you actually know what a calorie is? It&apos;s just, sometimes people use the phrase without actually knowing what they&apos;re saying.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, please. Of course I know what a calorie is!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s a measurement of h- how fat you&apos;ll get?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s a measurement of food energy, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Excellent! Um, how much energy?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The amount needed to heat one kilogram of water by one degree Celcius. And the suggested diet has a daily calorie level of around 2000.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So my energy needs are equivalent to slightly heating 2000 litres of water. That&apos;s, what - a big bathtub or an extremely tiny pool?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well! At least I now know that, EVERY DAY, we can each look ourselves in the mirror and ask, &quot;Are the sum total of my accomplishments today greater than a slightly heated giant bathtub?&quot;</line>

		<title>some readers get a double dose of raggin&apos; on fahrenheit. thanks sam for inspiring this comic!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Celsius is way better than Fahrenheit! Celsius puts zero at the point where water freezes, and 100 at the point where it boils. That&apos;s handy! Water&apos;s EVERYWHERE, man.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you&apos;re ever trapped in the past you can recreate Celsius, no problem!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But Fahrenheit? FAHRENHEIT is based on the temperature of brine for zero and the temperature of some eponymous dude&apos;s armpit for - 96 degrees? They should&apos;ve called it &quot;Armpits! The Temperature Scale&quot;.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Fahrenheit DOES ensure there&apos;s no negative numbers when dealing with commonly-encountered temperatures.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, boo hoo! So does Kelvin, and that&apos;s BASICALLY Celsius anyway!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think all this underscores how arbitrary these systems of measurement are!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What? How?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re always just picking two temperatures and dividing the space between up into arbitrary degrees! We could just as easily be dealing with the freezing and boiling points of a 50/50 mixture of champagne and caviar, say.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ...Oh My God.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: YES.</line>
				<line>Narrator: SOON:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: The Classiness Scale. Degrees are easily measured in &quot;PC&quot;, or &quot;degrees pure class&quot;!</line>
				<line>[[off-panel]]: So you&apos;d say that it&apos;s what... 20 degrees of Pure Class out today?</line>

		<title>this comic at one point was about t-rex&apos;s womanliest woman, the venus to his mars, the muliebrity to his virility</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>GOD: T-REX HOW COME YOUR IDEA OF ULTIMATE MANLINESS INVOLVES HIGH FIVING THREE WOMEN AT ONCE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I dunno.  Probably because it&apos;s awesome!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: As the saying goes, &quot;three women are trice as nice&quot;!</line>
				<line>GOD: OKAY YEAH PROBABLY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU EQUATE MANLINESS WITH POLYAMORY AND I FIND THAT REALLY INTERESTING</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, with high fives standing in for sex? It&apos;s not THAT interesting. Our culture equates virility with manliness, and so, hey presto, someone who can get more people pregnant is manlier!  It&apos;s super dumb because getting someone pregnant isn&apos;t difficult!  People do it accidentally ALL THE TIME.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I really don&apos;t see this &quot;pregnancies induced equals manliness&quot; connection!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Really?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yes really. I don&apos;t see the paragon of manhood as being able to successfully deliver sperm to the most eggs.  It&apos;s a very literally biological view of manliness, you know?  I think we as a gender can aim higher. </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Fine. Utahraptor, what&apos;s your manliness man then?</line>
				<line>Narrator: UTAHRAPTOR&apos;S MANLIEST MAN:</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Someone who is able to lead well, but also is able to admit and correct their mistakes.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: weaaaaaaaak</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Also someone who doesn&apos;t heckle their friends when he disagrees.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The wind is awesome.  So awesome!  You can stand on the edge of a cliff, leaves swirling around you, staring out in the wind - into DESTINY - and it&apos;s just great.  Everything feels dramatic and apocalyptic and awesome.  It&apos;s WAY better than trying to stare out into destiny during a snow storm, believe you me!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I have taken the aesthetics and beliefs of the romanticism movement and adopted them for my own!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I now emphasize my own subjective experience as visionary and transcendental!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I no longer value piety or virtue, or constancy (or consistency), or even the search for scientific truth!  I only value my own capacity for experience!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: As a consequence, my own actions can no longer be judged by any public idea of right or wrong!  As experience is amoral, even my own conscience cannot judge my actions, and I am free from reproach and judgment!</line>

				<line>Panel 1.2</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ok, if you&apos;re reading this path, it means you were spacing out for a long time and didn&apos;t start reading until now. Or you were camping out here for a while. In which case, congrats! Secret story path!!!</line>
				<line>Panel 2.1</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Wow, you got here fast! You either skipped ahead, or camped a while. I admire your patience... or lack thereof.</line>
				<line>Panel 2.2</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But not too fast. It&apos;s not a race or anything. Just read at your own pace.</line>
				<line>Panel 2.3</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You sure took your sweet time getting here! That&apos;s ok, we&apos;ll take the leisurely route. Suits me just fine.</line>
				<line>Panel 2.4</line>
				<line>T-Rex: YOU HAVE BEEN SLAIN BY AN UNRULY PACK OF BABOONS. YOU WIN!</line>
				<line>Panel 3.1</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Does anything of substance happen in this story? Or do we just humor the reader as he or she fumbles through the novelty of this storytelling device?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus. What is an adventure but a fumbling through novelty? And through such rites of passage, are there not guides along the way to &quot;humor&quot; the initiate?</line>
				<line>Panel 3.2</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So by &quot;Choose Your Own&quot;, you mean have the narrative thrust at you haphazardly in accordance with your natural reading pace?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: YES!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So no choice at all then, unless you want to awkwardly modify your reading habits.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But aren&apos;t all our &quot;choices&quot; bound by our personal limitations anyway?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Looks like you win that argument!</line>
				<line>Panel 3.3</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: When I start reading a panel and it changes suddenly, I feel like I am being punished for not reading fast enough.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Punished? No. REWARDED. With a tantalizing glimpse of a story path you are not yet meant to behold!</line>
				<line>Panel 3.4</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Seriously, would anyone take this long to get to this panel?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: These are fertile camping grounds my friend.</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Tra-la-la.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.1:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I fail to grasp the objection you may or may not have voiced in the previous panel. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: OH WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, I suppose we could just leave it at that in this story path. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: YOU GOT IT.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.2</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What&apos;s all this now?? </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: For starters, have you noticed sometimes while you&apos;re in the middle of reading a sentence, the panel suddenly changes?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Why yes. What of it?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: IT&apos;S AWFUL.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: IT&apos;S ADVENTUROUS.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.3</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Um, say what???????</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ok, let me explain. Unlike a typical CYOA with pages that set up different story branches with some detail, these shifting panels have us fly by the seat of our pants! Each one has to be generic to fit whatever preceded it.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: WH-WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAahem. As I was about to say before that panel shift. Utahraptor, so what if the panels fit a generic mold to suit any preceding event? Other CYOAs work that way too. You either get killed by a shark... or maybe a lion!!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: YOU CAN&apos;T DO THAT.</line>
				<line>Panel 5.5</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Do what?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: YOU CAN&apos;T DO WHAT WE&apos;RE DOING NOW. That is, continue a conversation from the same panel after it just switched. That panel was a separate story path! It&apos;s like two people in different dimensions talking to each other!!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: WHOA, AWESOME</line>
				<line>Panel 5.6</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: NO, NOT AWESOME.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t see what the big deal is. We&apos;re having a nice chat.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But people just entering this panel have no idea what we&apos;re talking about.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Those rae some slow readers. Anyway, they can find out, by camping!</line>
				<line>Panel 5.7</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But that is not in the spirit of this storytelling model! Man, look, this whole thing is unhinged now. You totally broke the CYOA format you invented. Happy?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I didn&apos;t invent it! I am merely the excitable spokesman for the concept presently.</line>
				<line>Panel 6.1</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Thanks for reading! If all went well, you will have spent way too long looking at this image, and are now feeling a little dizzy!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: You know what? FINE. I&apos;ll be the guy they find dead in front of his TV ten years later. It actually sounds kinda awesome, and as the saying goes, &quot;If you can&apos;t beat &apos;em, then you might as well die alone in front of a television set&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Pretty sure that&apos;s how the saying goes!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: How are you going to pull this off, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s surprisingly easy! Automatic payments for rent and utilities, a timer to turn the lights and TV on and off each day, and a robot vacuum that&apos;ll push any new mail away from my mail slot so it won&apos;t pile up! And my neighbours won&apos;t miss me, because I&apos;ll tell them this is but one of the MANY homes I keep.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Okay, but what about emails and other online communication?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No problem!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ll be OLD, Utahraptor. The Eliza bot I&apos;ll hook up to my email should be at least as lucid as I&apos;ll be by then! People will get her responses and say &quot;Huh! T-Rex sure has gotten good at responding to certain key phrases in my emails!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I already say that.</line>

				<line>T-Rex:Looks like you dropped the ball, NLP researchers!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex- Because MY email autoresponder takes in text with all sorts of imperfect and rreguar language, disambiguates word sense, builds a semantic understanding AND generates an appropriate response in the time it would take a real person to type it out. Oh snap! Did a rank amateur, wanting only to ensure that his body wouldn&apos;t be discovered for a few years after he died, just brutally advance the state of the art? SEEMS LIKE IT BABY!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So how&apos;s it work?</line>
				<line>TiRex: Just fine, thank you!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: No, I mean, how&apos;d you do it, how did you figure ut the semantics and word senses? Statistical methods? But those have problems with recall and precision, even with - are you using the web as a corpus? How are you handling the noise?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor, please! So many questions!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I just wrote &quot;Email Responder TWO THOUSAND&quot; on a giant novelty chef&apos;s hat, taped a page from the dictionary to it, and then stuffed the whole deal into my computer&apos;s CD tray!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Why do you think that&apos;s a problem, T-Rex?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It happens in a bunch of stories, Dromiceiomimus, I&apos;m really not sure how you missed them</line>

				<line>T-Rex: So?!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s gonna happen: AIs will happily take over email, sending replies that eventually only other AIs will respond to. Released from the shackles of responding to email, we&apos;ll become decadent, fat and complacent. We&apos;ll DIE OFF, Utahraptor.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I don&apos;t really see --</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ll simply make my AI play billions and billions of games of Tic Tac Toe, and in doing so it will realize the fundamental futility of war!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Yes.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Yes, also that.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s not really surprising, I guess, since every language EVER has been spoken by people who once were alive and are now totes dead. Similarly, every language has concepts of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;, which suggests that we, as a people, find naughty bits interesting!</line>

People will say, &quot;Hey, do you have any biological descendants?&quot; and you&apos;ll be able to say &quot;Man, WHO KNOWS??&quot; Plus, you&apos;ve done it all without the hassle of unplanned pregnancies!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: But billionaires aren&apos;t uniformly jolly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s true.  Okay, so clearly there&apos;s a function where money buys happiness with less efficiency as happiness increases.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Dentists are totally CYBERNETICISTS.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know, Dromiceiomimus, I was skeptical of myself too! But teeth naturally accumulate plaque and decay.  Dentists apply technology to biological life (me!) to upgrade my smile and stop biological decline!  Isn&apos;t that what cyberneticists do??</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Cyberneticists study the structure of regulatory systems.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Honestly I don&apos;t know what you feel that brings to the conversation.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Doesn&apos;t technology have to be implanted to make you a cyborg?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They implant fillings!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dentists are cyberneticists that operate with metal scrapers instead of experimental medical contraband, and the result is cleaner teeth instead of glowing red pupils. </line>

				<line>T-Rex: If I say &quot;Guys, I know I&apos;m rad&quot;, what am I saying? What does it actually mean to KNOW something? Philosophers have struggled with this for ages!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Luckily, the answer is super easy and they should have come up with it sooner!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Knowledge of anything, radness included, comes about if three conditions are met: that this thing is true, that I believe it to be true, and that I have a JUSTIFIED cause for this belief! Perhaps my justification of radness is that I&apos;ve been shot out of a cannon onto a motorbike, which is extremely rad. When these three conditions are met, then I&apos;ve got what&apos;s called a Justified True Belief, and that, my friends, is what knowledge is!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: However, once in your room I startle a sleepy murderer, who without alarming you, quietly murders me, stuffs me in the closet, and then goes back to nappy times - in your bed!! A few minutes later you say, &quot;Nice. An orange dude is sleeping in my bed.&quot; Clearly, this is justified, and it may even be true.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But only if the murderer was orange! Don&apos;t you see? It&apos;s sheer luck that this murderer was coloured to make your belief true. Are you really going to call random chance &quot;knowledge&quot;?</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  This seems pretty reasonable.  But it can&apos;t possibly be the case!  If you take me, I&apos;ve got two parents.  My parents have two parents themselves, so this means that three generations ago, four people are needed to eventually produce me.  Another generation back, we&apos;re eight people, and five generations ago gives me sixteen ancestors!</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  Okay that&apos;s a metaphor, but just BARELY.  It&apos;s basically a literal description of what&apos;s going on.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: You want to be the first murderer in space?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No, man! That&apos;s a sucky way to go down in history. But as the first MURDEREE in space, going out as a floating corpse in Zero G: that&apos;s something! And it&apos;s totally easy. All I need to do is convince some spaceman, when the time comes, to murder me!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s for the courts to decide, my friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Listen, bottom line: when my time on this planet is just about up, I&apos;m going up into space and you&apos;re going to murder me, okay? Surprise me with a knife!</line>

		<title>i once dreamed that i cheated on my girlfriend and woke up feeling AWFUL.  it wasn&apos;t until i was in the shower that i actually remembered it was all a dream!  the sense of relief was palpable; it was so great that i kinda wish i had dreams like this more</title>

				<line>T-Rex: Finally, things were looking up for dream T-rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This was at noon, dream time, and the plane was to leave at six. I made myself a sandwich, but it must&apos;ve taken a while, because when I looked at the clock, it was 6:30 already! I&apos;d missed my flight AND party entirely, and my friends all chastised me for being so dumb. &quot;Why didn&apos;t you leave at least two hours for check in with an international flight?&quot; they said!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So you dreamed about being cussed out?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, it was great!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I remember saying &quot;OBVIOUSLY it was a dumb mistake, guys. It&apos;ll never happen again; now I know to always leave plenty of time to get to the airport!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And when you woke up you remembered that moral!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m now learning life lessons WHILE I SLEEP, Utahraptor. I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ve moved on to the next stage of existence. I&apos;m pretty sure when I wake up tomorrow, I&apos;ll be a being of PURE ENERGY. I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ll come back and visit though, so no worries!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: In the 1300&apos;s, the regular chicks and dudes in England were speaking what we&apos;d call &quot;Middle English&quot;, a rapidly developing alternative to the Latin and French used in religion and government.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It was an exciting time to be saying &quot;Forsooth&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And some of these dudes were big into English being developed as a &quot;real&quot; language, particularly one John Wycliffe, who decided to translate the Bible - one of, if not THE most important book of his time - into casual English. This would allow John&apos;s less educated countrymen to read it since, as it&apos;d been written in Latin since the 5th century, currently required either formal education or a priest to interpret it for you!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But when they started translating, they ran onto some problems!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Papal Resistance?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That, but also a lot of English words they needed didn&apos;t exist yet! So John invented them, and we still use his &quot;behemoth&quot;, &quot;puberty&quot;, and &quot;zeal&quot;. But he also needed a word for intestines&quot;, and the phrase he came up with - FOR THE BIBLE, I REMIND YOU - was &quot;arse ropes&quot;.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hilarious!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Only I didn&apos;t immediately notice the bear!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And the &quot;BEAR&quot; part of &quot;BEARable&quot; wasn&apos;t capitalized. So my impression was simply of a mug with black text stating &quot;Good friends make life bearable&quot;. It was this amazing mug of depression, a mug that broadcast to all who can read that life is pain, nothing but pain, that life will kill you and that only good friends can make it even briefly sustainable.</line>

Horses being the cars of olden times, remember? Just because Peggy didn&apos;t have a scientific underpinning doesn&apos;t mean he wasn&apos;t the result of people imagining better technologies!</line>

		<title>A.F.S. said the only reason life is APPARENTLY thriving is because nature doesn&apos;t want the death of an individual to end things forever.  With enough life running around and eating other life, you can have tons more misery to go around AND avoid the dange</title>

				<line>T-Rex: Man, speaking of pessimism, you know who&apos;s pessimistic?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Arthur Friggin&apos; Schopenhauer!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Not only did A.F.S. not believe that this is the best of all possible worlds, he supplied a proof that this is, in fact, the WORST of all possible worlds! First he assumed that the worst possible world would be sustainable, since if it ended, nobody would be around to suffer. Prolonged suffering across millenia beats instant death!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Clearly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: CLEARLY.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Then he observed that our world is good enough to support life, but just barely!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Life&apos;s everywhere, man!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure, but one small shift in orbit, a slight change in temperature, and it&apos;s a catastrophe on a global scale. There&apos;s no wiggle room; if our fragile world was only a little worse there would be no life on it at all!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Therefore ours is the worst of all possible worlds?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep! Because any worse and it wouldn&apos;t be a world, it would just be an empty planet without suffering, and nature ABHORS an empty planet without suffering.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Anyway!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I believe it was after this proof that A.F.S. added the &quot;Friggin&apos;&quot; to his name!</line>

				<line>Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique: LEITWORTSTIL</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Today is a good day I think for leitwortstil!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Leitwortstil is the purposeful repetition of words or phrases in a story, you guys!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example, a dog might always be described as &quot;that wacky jerk&quot; in a story, to underline what a wacky jerk that dog turned out to be. Or in a collection of stories, the same phrase might appear in each story, which helps tie them together as a whole! Leitwortstil ALSO happens when a character says the same word over and over and over again.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You mean like a catch phrase?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m not sure that counts as leitwortstil, does it? If it&apos;s just someone saying &quot;Gee golly jeepers!&quot;, and there&apos;s no theme or motif associated with it - then it&apos;s just there for laughs, isn&apos;t it?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: For example: stomping on things!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I am really good at stomping on things. Years of practice have enabled me to put my foot above an object, shift my weight to the foot with force, and thus compress whatever is beneath my foot. And should I see someone struggling with stomping, something SO HARD for them and yet so easy for me, I would gladly help them out!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Assuming they want it, of course.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Of course!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And you agree that this is the right thing for me to do, assuming nobody is hurt through the stomping.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Absolutely.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ...</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But I&apos;m STILL not cleaning raccoon poop off your porch, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: UTAHRAPTOR we just LOGICALLY PROVED that if raccoon poop makes me puke and you can handle it fine, then you should be the one cleaning it!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s right, britches!!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: See, that&apos;s still basically &quot;bitches&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I concede the point easily, backstitches!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So, new punctuation marks?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes! New punctuation marks!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so I want one that conveys all the sass of saying &quot;x, bitches!!&quot; without the casual cussing and for any value of x. I want punctuation that when read causes all readers - regardless of who or when they are - to whisper a frank and awed &quot;oh snap!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So invent it and convince everyone it&apos;s a good idea!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor, were you using my new punctuation there? Did you mean to convey &quot;Convince everyone it&apos;s a good idea, bitches!!&quot;?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Maslow was a dude who put all of our needs and desires into a hierarchy! The whole idea was that you can&apos;t satisfy any desire at the top of the hierarchy until you satisfy those beneath it.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nice going, Maslow!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: At the top is SELF ACTUALIZATION, which sounds pretty great, right? Except you can&apos;t get there unless you&apos;ve already satisfied the level beneath it, which is esteem. And you don&apos;t get esteem - both self and from others - without relationships, and you don&apos;t worry about friggin&apos; relationships until your basic safety needs are met. And finally, you don&apos;t worry about basic safety if you need to poop!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: &quot;You don&apos;t worry about basic safety if you need to poop.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Well, he said the gist of it.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: He did, did he?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, no, but he DID come up with the theoretical framework that allows a phrase such as mine to be reasonably constructed in a meaningful context.</line>

		<title>dollar auctions were invented by martin shubik, okay, so listen, mr. shubik, i like your name</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Dollars for sale! DOLLARS FOR SALE!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dollars for sale, you guys!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dollars for sale in an auction where everyone pays their highest bid, whether or not they win!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So when you bid 1 cent, Dromiceiomimus - FOR A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE DOLLAR - you&apos;ll be getting a great deal and you&apos;ll make a profit of 99 cents! But watch out, because if Utahraptor outbids you with 2 cents, then you could lose your penny!  Remember you have to pay your high bid either way.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So it&apos;s in my interest to outbid him with 3 cents: that way I can at least make a profit of 97 cents!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But then I&apos;ll just outbid her with the exact same motivation!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: True!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But then - if Dromiceiomimus bids 98 cents, I&apos;ll bid 99.  Then she has to decide whether to bid $1: if she doesn&apos;t, she loses 98 cents, but if she does, she&apos;ll break even.  So she does, and I&apos;m left with the choice of either losing my 99 cents, or of bidding $1.01 and then only losing 1 cent.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So I bid more than the dollar is worth, just to minimize my losses!  And it keeps on going, and we both end up bankrupt!  This is the worst ever auction, and I&apos;m not bidding.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Would you say... &quot;The only winning move is not to play?&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: No, I think that movie&apos;s been referenced enough lately</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Today is a good day, I think, for a guest comic.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m in a comic!?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It appears that by informing me of my current existence within a medium of entertainment, the guest comic author has already broken the so-called &quot;fourth wall&quot;.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Why should that matter?  Your existence now is in no way different than it was before.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: but as a character in a comic, I am required to be a source of entertainment.  This is a demand that I have up to now been unaware of. Thus I must provide the reader with some semblance of comedic banter... perhaps a pun using the phrase &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot; and my current action of crushing many walls.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I believe that particular point would have been better off remaining a subtle irony.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Since I do not have a joke readily available, I will just have to resort to entertainment through violence. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But you don&apos;t NEED to come up with a joke or rely on entertaining violence!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How so?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  As a character in a comic, you have no true free will of your own.  Nor do you think at all! It is the author that will com up with the joke.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But what if he forgets to come up with a funny punchline?  If I have no free will, does that mean that I will be forced to just take up space in the last caption and say nothing at all?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  If the author is a lazy bum, yes.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  I don&apos;t see a punchline!</line>
				<line>Narrator: Just say &quot;who the hell goes to Cornwall&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Seriously, who does that?</line>
				<line>Narrator: I know! Seriously!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I know, IT SOUNDS CRAZY, but stay with me!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We mortal people get an end to pain that immortal dudes never get. Unlike immortal dudes, there&apos;s a finite number of times I&apos;m going to stub my toe so hard that it breaks. One time I&apos;ll stub my toe and it&apos;ll break and I&apos;ll be able to say, &quot;There, that&apos;s done with. I&apos;m never stubbing my toe THAT friggin&apos; hard again. I can finally put this TOTALLY RIDICULOUS aspect of being alive behind me.&quot; - even if I could never know it at the time!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: One time when you say it, you&apos;ll have to be right!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So now when something bad happens, I&apos;ll assume I&apos;ll die soon, so it&apos;s the last time it&apos;ll ever happen to me. I&apos;ll be able to sigh and just let it go.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: They&apos;re cheezed-off ghost kids who just want to be buried properly. And if you encounter one, it hops on your back and demands to be taken to the nearest graveyard. And as you approach the graveyard they grow heavier and heavier, until they&apos;re so heavy that you can sink into the ground under their weight. And if that happens then they kill you in a rage and try again with the next guy!</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: David Hilbert was a mathematician and hotelier who was born in 1892.  He built an infinite hotel, you guys!</line>
				<line>Narrator: THE INFINITE HOTEL</line>
				<line>Narrator: A TRUE STORY</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So Hilbert built this infinite hotel that was infinitely big and had infinitely many rooms; I believe this was a matter of some investment.  But build it he did, and soon after a bus with infinity people in it showed up, with each of them wanting a room!  Lucky for Hilbert he had his infinite hotel, so each guest got a room, and the hotel was filled up to capacity.  Nice!  But just then another friggin&apos; bus showed up, and it ALSO had infinity people in it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Nobody builds for TWO infinite buses showing up right after the other!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Turns out they do!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He just told every guest already there to move into the room that was double their current room number.  So the guest in room 3 moved into room 6, and so on!  Thus, only the even-numbered rooms were occupied, and everyone on the new bus could have an odd-numbered room!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Amazing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!  Anyway!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s my understanding that he died an infinitely rich man infinity years later</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  History if full of chumps, you guys!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Today&apos;s historical chump is William H. Mumler (born 1832), who was a photographer guy who did portraits!  Only he wasn&apos;t very good photographer guy because one time he accidentally double-exposed some film, and the resulting image showed the one portrait clearly but also showed a ghostly image of the other portrait!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  So he threw away the photo and reminded himself not make that dumb mistake anymore?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Nope!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Instead he embarked on a career as a SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHER and made a lot of money duping a lot of people, including Abraham Lincoln&apos;s widow.  Only, peopleeventually started to notice that his &quot;ghosts&quot; looked an awful lot like living people around town!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  Hah!  Whoops!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  They ALSO eventually noticed how he was breaking into their houses so he could look at photographs and figure out what his ghosts were supposed to look like.  Anyway like everyone else from history he eventually died and now his entire life has been compressed to a short story, the end!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Some folks got opinions on what their genitals should be called, you guys!</line>

And some people are like, check it, MY vagina does tons more than the passive &quot;sheath&quot; implies, so let&apos;s call it something else!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what some people are like, Dromiceiomimus!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Yep!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But they can also be entirely free from any quasi-insulting Latinate etymology the other words have.  There&apos;s people trying to reclaim these currently-taboo words in the same way &quot;queer&quot; was!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Neat!  But largely irrelevant to us, as our reproduction is not through vaginal intercourse!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: AS YOU KNOW, we achieve intercourse through a cloacal kiss, the cloaca being of course our single shared intestinal, urinary, AND reproductive tract opening!</line>

But we&apos;ve all spent an afternoon saying something like &quot;waterpark&quot; over and over until there&apos;s nothing there, just sounds, just the empty shell of a word, waterpark, the oral equivalent of a forgotten childhood toy found in adulthood, now strange and alien and no longer coloured by desire, by anything, waterpark.

				<line>Utahraptor: I think it&apos;s happening to me! Waterpark, waterpark, waterpark.</line>

And it&apos;s also &quot;mama&quot; in Dutch, and in Romanian, and in Catalan, Slovak, Quechu, Romanian, Chinese, German, Russian, and MORE.

				<line>The Devil: AND LET US ENSURE THE CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANIC IS PRESENT AND UNMOLESTED</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe we could tweak it a bit though: advance it for the times!</line>
				<line>The Devil: WHAT EXCUSE ME T-REX BUT IF YOU WANT TO MESS WITH GAMEPLAY WHY BOTHER REMAKING A CLASSIC GAME</line>
				<line>The Devil: DO NOT BOTHER ANSWERING THAT QUESTION FOR THERE EXISTS NO ANSWER THAT CAN GIVE ANY SATISFACTION</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw man, things were going so well with the Devil for once!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What happened?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I suggested changing the gameplay mechanics while remaking an old game.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Why bother remaking a game if you&apos;re just going to change it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know, I know, I shouldn&apos;t answer that question, there exists no answer that can give any satisfaction.</line>
				<line>The Devil: T-REX I WOULD REQUEST AN INTRODUCTION TO YOUR FRIEND UTAHRAPTOR</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He&apos;s right there; just talk to him!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I have led my life believing that people who write down cuss words have bad things happen to them.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And it has worked out really well so far!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: When I saw someone writing a cuss, I would think &quot;It&apos;s okay, that person will have troubles down the line because of that, and then they&apos;ll realize why, and then they&apos;ll know not to write down cusses anymore. They will have learnt their lesson.&quot; But I wrote down some cusses last night and nothing bad happened!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nothing!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Maybe it was the cusses you chose?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what I thought!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But after smaller cusses didn&apos;t take, I worked up to the bigger ones. And even they weren&apos;t doing anything! By the time it was time for bed, I was writing out things like &quot;PROFESSOR BLEEPBURGLAR&quot; in my notebook, complete with doodled 3D effects!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And still no response, huh? Weird!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know! But then I realized there&apos;s probably a delay, so when a bunch of birds poop on my head later on this week I&apos;m not going to wonder why.</line>

				<line>Woman: This is Unix! I know this!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Also, I and you as well represent the threat of castration. Recall that the raptors were introduced with the image of a fossilized claw being used to &apos;geld&apos; the curious boy. Reading the dinosaurs as Woman (and recall that all the dinosaurs were cloned female) it appears that the message of the film is that femininity is dangerous and must be repressed!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve been thinking... If my decisions are based on my desires, and my desires are just the product of phsysiological and environmental factors beyond my control,</line>
				<line>T-Rex: then I have no control over the decisions I make!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: See, if I am just the psychological product of my environment, then each action I take I could not have taken in any other way.  I HAD NO CHOICE!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Isn&apos;t that just a bit too convenient?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  What?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well your theory fails to account for the fact that we obviously CAN make decisions, and that we do so constantly.  Can you really tell me that you think the brain is nothing more than a complicated computer with delusions of grandeur?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: We have this &quot;Mother Nature&quot; metaphor that we all share but rarely consider critically, and it has all these connotations that are sublimated into our lives and thinking! It suggests the planet tries to care for us as a mother would, sure, but it also suggests that plants and animals are provided by this mother with the intent of our nourishment, and that nature can carry parental authority!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Morris the tiny bug, it&apos;s been a while! How are you?</line>
				<line>Morris: oh i&apos;m fine, t-rex, it&apos;s very nice of you to ask</line>
				<line>Morris: only to tell you the truth i&apos;m not all that fine because i&apos;ve been under a lot of stress lately!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Stress?!</line>
				<line>Morris: oh, gosh, yes, i didn&apos;t even think things could get so stressful, but then they did! like for example i&apos;m worried about how i&apos;m ever gonna make friends when i get older. when you&apos;re just a kid, you&apos;ve got people in your classes to hang out with and the best part is, every year you&apos;ve got new classes and that means a heck of a lot of new friends! but when you&apos;re an adult you&apos;ve got a job instead of class, and people don&apos;t normally change jobs every year from what i&apos;ve seen, so maybe i&apos;m wrong but it seems like if your old friends move away and you&apos;re not friends with the folks at work, then it might be awful hard to make new friends!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aww, Morris, that&apos;s nothing you have to worry about now!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, you won&apos;t have to deal with that until you&apos;re way older!</line>
				<line>Morris: but doesn&apos;t it worry you fellas to have problems waiting for you like that?</line>
				<line>Morris: if i have a problem, my parents and role models always tell me that it&apos;s best to face it head on, rather than ignoring it and hoping it&apos;ll get better all on its own! because sometimes, that doesn&apos;t happen, and then you&apos;ve got an even bigger problem to deal with! and that&apos;s just the worst</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, that&apos;s right, but if you ever find yourself in this situation, you can just join a club or a team and meet new people that way!</line>
				<line>Morris: shucks utahraptor, that&apos;s awful good advice, but wouldn&apos;t you end up liking your free time but then feeling bad taht you have to spend the biggest part of your day with folks that aren&apos;t even your friends? and it really doesn&apos;t seem like you&apos;re allowed to ask how friendly folks are during a job interview</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Morris, I guess sometimes your problems really ARE difficult!</line>

		<title>PLATONIC FORMS</title>

				<line>T-Rex: Plato was a philosopher guy who said perfect dudes don&apos;t exist. Rather, all dudes are the imperfect instantiations of the perfect ideal of dudes, the essential dude, intangible essence of dudeness!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Plato also said things like &quot;I&apos;m hungry guys, frig!&quot; but we&apos;re not remembering him for that right now!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ours is an imperfect world, and as such there&apos;s no perfect dudes in it. All the dudes we have are imperfect instances - copies, if you will- of the ideal dude, who is so great he can&apos;t even EXIST.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But what about if you and I have different ideas about what the perfect dude is?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: It&apos;s just I&apos;m - I&apos;m pretty sure we do.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Plato really said this about... dudes?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, NO, not technically.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He was actually talking about everything, but that includes dudes! I used dudes because it&apos;s an example EVERYONE can get behind.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Wouldn&apos;t circles be a better example? We can all imagine the perfect circle, but we can&apos;t draw one.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Um, computers can??</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Those are pixelated if you look closely, T-Rex! And before you say &quot;robots can&quot;, they still draw on some medium, and that&apos;s made of atoms.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And atoms are NATURE&apos;S pixels! You just proved my case for me! Awesome!</line>

And now all males have these HYPODERMIC STAB WEINERS, and the women are left with fully-functional genital tracts that are only used when it&apos;s time to deposit the eggs!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The ladies evolved some countermeasures though, didn&apos;t they?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s DEFINITELY time for me to fix the great works of fiction!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The great out-of-copyright works of fiction, anyway. My brilliant idea is to completely recontextualize them through the magic of framing stories! So for example, instead of Moby Dick being about this guy after a whale, it&apos;s this CRAZY SCIENTIST writing whaler fan fiction, and at the end, the scientist stops and says &quot;Sheesh, I didn&apos;t mean to write so much whaler fan fiction.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And Moby Dick takes place in the middle?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And Pride and Prejudice is still this fancy romance story, but now it&apos;s framed by this dude being asked to describe the ultimate video game, and at the end the dude says &quot;Anyway after that it becomes a turned-based strategy game with a focus on resource management&quot;.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: ...Huh.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hamlet ends as it normally does, but then the framing play starts up again and it&apos;s Hamlet&apos;s dad looking into a crystal ball, and he says &quot;Forsooth, now let&apos;s see what would happen if I won the lottery!!&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Wow! I guess we need to know how much our planet is worth, then. I&apos;m guessing... a kabazillion dollars?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What if we took the sum value of all the world&apos;s currencies? That&apos;d tell us how much everything is worth, in total!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That works, right? Because money itself isn&apos;t worth anything, but we all PRETEND it&apos;s worth the value of the goods it&apos;s traded for, right?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Except that doesn&apos;t include oceans and stuff - things you can&apos;t buy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: TRUE.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Plus, buying the WHOLE DANG PLANET means buying everything on it, and that means we now have to put a price on LIFE ITSELF.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I always knew this day would come, Utahraptor. I - I just never thought it&apos;d be soon.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Alright! Life itself is, what - like twenty bucks?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: You know what? We totally can put an exact price on life, down to the nearest cent.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In fact, we do it all the time!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Every time we land somewhere on the gradient between safety and expense, we do it. If a new ambulance costs $100,000 but would likely save at least 100 lives while it was in use, and we decide NOT to buy it, then we&apos;re saying those particular lives aren&apos;t worth $1000. Ouch! Sorry, ambulance dudes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But maybe we don&apos;t have the money to buy an ambulance anyway!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure! It&apos;s not a perfect measurement.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: All I&apos;m saying is we ESTIMATE it all the time. Heck, you do it whenever you&apos;re paid hourly and you speed into work! Divide the extra money you get by being there sooner by the increase chance of death the added speed brings you, and you&apos;ve just VALUED YOUR OWN LIFE.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: ...I - I guess so!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: On the flip side, whenever housecleaners clean a bathroom, they&apos;re PAID to kill the bacteria there! So those tiny lives are worth negative dollars. And there&apos;s SO MANY bacteria, Utahraptor!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: So! Since the Universe is TOTALLY MEANINGLESS, looking for any sort of meaning in life is absurd, and we&apos;re all sorta stuck. But lucky for us, the absurdist philosophers came up with three ways to resolve this! The - the first resolution is suicide.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve said it before, but I&apos;ll say it again: the absurdists were not the cheeriest potatoes in the bag.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But if we don&apos;t want to kill ourselves, we can find religion, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Right!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Religion can give hope of a kind and caring world beyond our absurd one. But since they see reason as the greatest tool we&apos;ve got and religion relies on faith, it&apos;s rejected by the absurdists as a (just as deadly!) PHILOSOPHICAL suicide.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: And that&apos;s just where it starts. After my would-be heirs spend the night in the haunted house, which is clearly specified in my will to be ACTUALLY HAUNTED,  they have to successfully navigate a series of dares and challenges - punching bears, eating chairs, that sort of thing - all designed to bring them together and underline a valuable life lesson: &quot;MONEY ISN&apos;T EVERYTHING&quot;. Then they get the money.</line>

But if I were big into applesauce (or big AGAINST applesauce) I&apos;d be way more into answering the survey.

				<line>T-Rex: The Nutrinomicon divides foods into four different &apos;groups.&apos; These &apos;groups&apos; have prescribed allowances per day.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: By following the nutritional regime of the Nutrinomicon, you can be assured of a fine diet!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Your &quot;Nutrinomicon&quot; is nothing more than a Food Guide, repackaged!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: All the major governments have published Food Guides, which do exactly what your Nutrinomicon purports to do: divide food into groups, and describe how much of each group is allowable for a balanced diet.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Computational linguistics is the study of computer-based language processing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A major area of computational linguistics is that of &quot;ambiguity resolution&quot;. It turns out that many things people say in a language - English, for example - can have more than one meaning!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Consider the phrase &quot;fruit flies like a banana&quot;. Is it describing the taste of fruit flies, or rather flying fruit? How can a computer hope to figure this out?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: I agree!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I did some research!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I found a book called &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Basically it gives advice for having loving polygamous relationships. A lot of it makes sense! Like say your girlfriend has a best friend, and they go out one night. You&apos;re happy for her, right? You love her, you want her to be happy. So why should that change when you add sex to it? The book also posits that an artificial &apos;economy of scarcity&apos; in sex leads to jealousy and possessiveness.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re saying that because sex is &apos;rare&apos;, it has increased value, and is therefore treasured unreasonably? </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what the book says, anyway. It&apos;s not anti-monogamy, but it is pro-polygamy. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But don&apos;t you find that these things don&apos;t work in real life? I know I want my partner to be happy, but I also want all of his or her kisses.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Artificial economy of scarcity, my friend! Like diamonds!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I have been thinking about what the Utahraptor said yesterday, and by extension the ambiguity allowable in language!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Take the Bible, for instance!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: There&apos;s a text passed down for hundreds of generations, translated, re-written, re-edited.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Even if you don&apos;t assume that it&apos;s the word of God, the difference in meaning between what was written THEN and what you read NOW must be staggering!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s often said that the only way to be immortal is through your words and ideas!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I agree!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But the Bible shows us that language is mutable!  So what&apos;s the solution?  How can I ensure that the ideas I have in my head when I communicate are the same as those you get in yours when you hear me?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I propose a rigorously defined language without syntactic or lexical ambiguity!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But how would we write puns in such a language?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Eh?</line>

				<line>Narrator: HOW TO MEET NEW PEOPLE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Meeting new people can be fun!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It can be tiring if you are meeting a lot of new people at once, however. Here are some tips on how to meet lots of people at once:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;#8226; Wear something that will identify you and make you easy-to-remember! I recommend a &quot;crazy&quot; scarf or a large disfiguring scar.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Listen attentively to people&apos;s names when you meet them! If their name is the same as yours, laugh!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;ve got one!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Try to remember interesting stories about yourself. Having such stories close at hand allows you both to fill in awkward gaps in conversation, and also acts to give people a quick, hopefully representative picture of yourself!</line>

				<line>Narrator: Today&apos;s origin story: THE PHRASE &quot;BALLS TO THE WALL&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Many people assume the origin of this phrase has to do with testicles!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In fact, it&apos;s quite the opposite. The phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The &quot;balls&quot; in question referred to the knobs on top of the plane&apos;s throttle control. When the throttle was at full, the &quot;balls&quot; would be &quot;to the wall&quot; of the cockpit!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And that&apos;s the origin of the phrase &quot;balls to the wall&quot;.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You are incorrect! The phrase comes from olde-fashioned steam-powered trains!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s true! Basically, the engines had two weighted balls, attached to a vertical shaft that was connected to the engine. As the engine speed increased, these two balls would be raised higher because of centrifugal force! At top speed, they would be parallel to the ground, nearly touching the &quot;walls&quot; of the shaft!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hence, &quot;balls to the wall&quot;! Man!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s sweet!</line>

				<line>Narrator: Today&apos;s origin story: YOUR SENSE OF DISENCHANTMENT</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Your sense of disenchantment comes from a realization that the world is not as you believed!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: People lie and get away with it. Murders go unsolved! There are people who only interact with you because they think it might be profitable for them.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You were raised on fairy tales, where there were no moral grey areas, where good and bad were clear, where there was never any real doubt over which side would win in the end!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Each lurid death reported in the paper akes you a little more cynical: a little more dead inside.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Wait!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What if this sense of disenchantment came not from a flawed world, but rather a growing realization that they themselves are flawed? Nothing&apos;s more depressing than realizing that you can&apos;t live up to your hopes, that you&apos;ll never live out your dreams, that you probably let those you care about down, everyday!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Today I will be the one to impress my dentist with my personal oral hygiene!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I spent an hour this morning making sure that my teeth were sparkly clean.  I practiced in the mirror saying &quot;Of course I floss after every meal&quot;, &quot;Of course, Doctor!  I floss after every meal&quot;, and &quot;Floss after every meal?  Of course!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I practiced until I got it RIGHT.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, do you floss after every meal?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Not hardly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But every time I go he asks, and every time I feel like I let him down - personally, you know?  Like he has twenty kids and I&apos;m the only one who doesn&apos;t floss and he doesn&apos;t know why.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s very sad.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It gets sadder!  Sometimes I imagine he&apos;s bought books on how to get your kid to floss, and he&apos;s tried everything the books say but still, I don&apos;t floss - and he&apos;s started to wonder if there is something wrong with HIM.  Has he failed me as a dentist?  As a FATHER?  Where did it all go wrong?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The differences between adults and children are many!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example: while adults are by definition fully grown, children are much smaller! Adults have more life experiences than children, who may have very little! Adults, legally, are fully-recognized people, while children are not! They do not have the same rights.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes, there are many differences between adults and children!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hey, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What is it, Utahraptor?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I was just babysitting my adult neighbor. But then I realized: wait,  you don&apos;t babysit adults! You only babysit CHILDREN!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How embarrassing!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Oh, I know it!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I would like to reward you for being my friend! What would yo like?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, I didn&apos;t become your friend because of the chance of a reward! I&apos;m not sure this is a good idea: people might find it insulting!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Is that true? Could others take my offer of prizes to be an insult?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Easily!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Here&apos;s why: it implies that being your friend is somehow deserving of recompense. You insult yourself, but you also insult us, because if we were truly your friends, we wouldn&apos;t want prizes! The fact that you are offering them implies you think we&apos;d take them, which implies that you think our friendship is insincere!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Today, gentle reader of the comic in which I am a character, (perhaps the TITLE character?) we are going to break the 4th wall.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We may, in fact, be doing it now!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: It&apos;s called the fouth wall in theatre because of the three walls of the set, isn&apos;t it? In comics, wouldn&apos;t we call it the fifth wall? The first four walls would be the four sides of the panel, wouldn&apos;t they?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: N... No?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think she&apos;s right, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The question you have to ask yourself now, is which of the four walls did you break?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh no!</line>
				<line>{{alt-text: it would be funny to do another one that is the same, but then the side panel on the right breaks, and he&apos;s like, &apos;oh.&apos;}}</line>

				<line>T-Rex: *gasp*</line>
				<line>T-Rex: As a male, I take on the position of the Everyman - with the latter syllable perhaps the most important from our post-Feminist perspective. The house clearly represents repressed femininity, at once recalling the blissful days of the past, while reminding us of their fundamental injustices. My action in destroying the house remains a puzzling enigma.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The emphasis on male oppression is continued as I stand poised to crush this woman beneath my man-foot.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: No!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;ve always seen you more as representing the essential struggle between man and his darker half.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, that is a part of it, to be sure.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ...but the desires of my darker nature manifest themselves as misogyny! Surely that must enter into your analysis!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: And all the men wore hats while the women baked pies!  Sure, we had the stability we craved after the turmoil of WWII, but at what cost?  Repression both sexual and sociological left lasting scars, leading in many ways to the cultural self-doubt of the 60s but who cares, we&apos;ve got to plan this party!</line>

I got in ONE LITTLE FIGHT and my mom got scared, and said</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: But we&apos;d be stuck in a certain time period, because people would never die!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure they would!</line>

				<line>Narrator: &quot;CREDIT CARD FRAUD&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Credit card fraud is a growing problem in today&apos;s society!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I believe the fault of this lies in the inherent design flaws of the credit card system.  If I give a credit card to someone, that should authorize one purchase, for a specific amount, at that specific time!  Instead, knowing someone&apos;s credit card information allows you to make charges to it for any amount, at any time, all over the world!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This certainly is a lot of talk about credit cards!  Aren&apos;t there any more pressing issues, T-Rex?</line>

				<line>Narrator: It is true that as a dinosaur, the T-Rex should have been inclined toward gnashing his ferocious jaws and making claws of his little hands, but he had been stomping on things for so long that no one remembered a time when he had gnashed instead of stomped.</line>
				<line>Narrator: Inside, he wanted to gnash, but he doubted himself. He knew that he could stomp. He was not sure he could gnash.</line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;DINOSAUR COMICS&quot; by Robert Service.</line>
				<line>Narrator: Well it was long ago, on some grim plateau, When this story first was told, About a land in fear made more severe By a terrible threat of old.</line>
				<line>Narrator: And though the men were brave, the risks were grave In these misty days of yore; None could ever be safe, in this ancient place, From the threat of Dinosaur.</line>
				<line>Narrator: Now the dinosaurs had their fearsome roars, But they had their friendships, too; And while they stalked they often talked, And debated what was true.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Charles Babbage spent a lot of his time working on mechanical calculating engines!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: These were machines that could add and subtract, and later multiply and divide (through repeated addition and subtraction), forecasting in many ways the design of modern-day computers!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Unfortunately the machines, with thousands of tiny gears and cogs, were too complex, beyond his means to fully manufacture at the time (early 1800s).</line>
				<line>T-Rex: While some see Babbage as the father of modern computers, he had little actual influence!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yes, quite right!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This is because many of the innovations in his Analytical Engine, such as conditional branching and a separation of processing and memory, were left to be re-discovered by a new generation of pioneers!</line>

		<title>this summer: the earth stops and everybody flies into a wall</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I have an idea for the ULTIMATE disaster movie: basically, what happens is the Earth stops dead in its orbit one day, and everybody flies into a wall!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: (Or, if they&apos;re outside, into the sky!)</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah hah!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Best movie ever!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So It&apos;d be told in a series of shorts: each short starts a little before everybody flies into a wall, and ends with everybody flying into a wall.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It would be SO GOOD! You start out small: regular people, a fat guy at a buffet, building up to a parking lot full of cars tumbling into the sky, the star quarterback kicking the ball and then he, and everybody else in the game, flying up after it.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Your movie sounds awesome!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But wouldn&apos;t it get a little repetitive?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No way! The viewers would know what&apos;s going on after the first few shorts, so you play off those expectations. Like, there&apos;s this shot of a really elaborate wedding, and the audience is all, &quot;Oh man, all those people are going to fly into a wall SO HARD!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And then we cut to years afterwards, when they&apos;re old and stooped, holding hands out on the porch, and THEN the Earth stops in its orbit and they fly off together into the sky!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah hah! Two tickets, please!</line>

		<title>the bad news is there&apos;s finitely many songs about sad robots</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I submit that there are a finite number of songs! Therefore, the art of writing music is the art of exploring a closed space of possibility.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Consider the following!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: There are effective limits on what constitutes music. If we take a week as a very generous upper-bound on the length of one song, then we have a temporal limit. Furthermore, since our ears are not able to distinguish between very similar tones, we do not have a continuum of notes, but rather, a finite set. Therefore, there are only so many songs that can be written!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I am forced to disagree with you, my friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Surely not!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think that you&apos;re omitting many dimensions of song. What about the way it&apos;s played, the lyrics? These too can be varied almost indefinitely.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Almost, but there are still effective limits, therefore: finite number of songs!</line>
				<line>Narrator: SHOCK ENDING:</line>

				<line>Narrator: T-REX AS: &quot;THE COMPUTER SCIENTIST&apos;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Computers store information in binary code, which is a series of 1s and 0s!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In fact, ALL information in a computer - text, video, sound, even PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES - are stores in the same fashion, as 1s and 0s. Here&apos;s the interesting part:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Any series of 1s and 0s can be converted (quite easily) into a regular number! So, for instance, your favorite song is contained - quite literally - in one single, 4 million digit number.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So copyright las is in a state of self-contradiction!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Quit right!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You can&apos;t copyright a fact (like a number), but you can copyright a creative work, like a song or a piece of software. But since one can be transformed into another, copueight law is logically INCOHERENT.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s really cool!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I know!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But, being really cool IS one of the perks of being a computer scientist!</line>

				<line>Narrator: part 2</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so we covered how everything in a computer is stored in binary code!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And we covered how any series of binary digits (called bits) can be transformed into a number. But these numbers are really large! They take a long time to send to someone. Luckily, it&apos;s possible to send any number, and therefore any file of ANY size, using only two</line>
				<line>T-Rex: single</line>
				<line>T-Rex: bits.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Sure, all you need are sychronized timers! Send one bit to say &apos;start counting&apos; and a second to say &apos;stop!&apos;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah! Then all you have to do is count the amount of time between when you got the &apos;start&apos; and &apos;end&apos; bits, and that&apos;s your number! Transform it into binary code, and you&apos;ve got your file!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well - yeah!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ha ha, I knew it! I am the smartest dude!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, but there&apos;s more to being smart than knowing compression schemes!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: In practice, I guess I would need more experience with women, emotionally distant or otherwise.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What, are you talking about me? You&apos;re saying I&apos;m emotionally distant!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, who are you talking about then, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Just - you know, in general! I wasn&apos;t talking about anyone in particular.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, but you were complaining about ex-girlfriends in front of a woman whom you&apos;ve dated in the past! That&apos;s not exactly a recipe for social harmony.</line>

		<title>presentism</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: T-REX IN: &quot;PRESENTISM&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Its danger is not just that it is often self-congratulatory, but also that judging historical figures by present-day moral standards is likely not a fruitful line of inquiry. What we see as questionable (say, sexism!) would have seemed completely routine to someone brought up in such a time, and we can&apos;t really blame historical figures, I think, for not questioning it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This seems awfully close to ethical relativism!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, aren&apos;t you saying we can&apos;t judge historical figures in a modern context, because they lived their lives during different times? But then what&apos;s the point of having our advanced modern ideals, if we can&apos;t apply them? I think we SHOULD be able to judge historical figures!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Anyway! In conclusion, presentism has good points and bad points and is not as interesting as I thought it was!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: You, ah - you seem a little more vehement than usual, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They pus my buttons, is all!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think it&apos;s because most of the predictions are either really dumb or blindingly obvious.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: HISTORIOGRAPHY COMICS featuring &quot;Good Ol&apos; T-Rex&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Historiography is the history of history, and includes the study of how history is understood!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We tend to think that history is just a record of what goes on in the past, but this overlooks the fact that two different people can view the same event, and even the same series of events, differently.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For instance!  Is history the story of progress, from savage to cultured Man?  Is it rather the study of Great Men and their Characters?  Perhaps it is the story of cultural challenge and response!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What&apos;s with the sexist language, T-Rex?  You&apos;re all &quot;great MEN, cultured MEN&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sorry!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Most of these theories of history are over 50 years old, and reflect the sexism in the language at the time.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, if I were a woman, I think I&apos;d be a little offended</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I had to be careful not to let him know I&apos;d considered this situation before.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ha ha!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I actually meant my question in the most basic sense, but I want to appear deep. I&apos;d better act angsty and play along. </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, my existential angst! Is there no happiness without knowledge of purpose?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hey, I&apos;m happy!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This is because I believe we&apos;re here in order to be witness to Creation. What greater purpose could there be, than to be the eyes and ears and souls of a Universe?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Well, there are valid and invalid generalizations, my friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, that&apos;s true!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But I guess what bothers me is that it seems you determine whether or not a generalization is valid by evaluating its conclusion, which in turn is based on your own prejudices!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well - it&apos;s hard to remove the &quot;human factor&quot; from any evaluation like this.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You mean the &quot;dinosaur factor&quot;, of course!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: But without money people would still trade!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And...?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: AND, currency is just an abstraction of trade!  One unit of currency equals three goats, for example.  Some form of money develops naturally from trade and is thus, I think, pretty much inevitable!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Social Skills are very important things to have!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They are what allow us to get along with others, and are the foundation of society!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: With the invention of the &quot;#8220;internet&quot;#8221; and &quot;#8220;email&quot;#8221; and &quot;#8220;instant messaging software&quot;#8221;, people are more social than ever &quot;#8211; and this increased chance for communication leads to better social skills! Hooray!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ah, but this electronic communication can take away from face-to-face interaction!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Doesn&quot;#8217;t matter!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Actually, it does &quot;#8211; because they&quot;#8217;re not the same thing! Online, if you don&quot;#8217;t like someone, you can ignore them easily and completely. But in real life, you have to talk to people you disagree with or dislike all the time! I&quot;#8217;m worried the skills for dealing with such people will become ATROPHIED.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Does &quot;Betty put butter on the bread&quot; mean the same thing as &quot;Betty buttered the bread&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I would argue: no!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In the second example, there is an implication that the bread is wholly buttered, while in the first, this is not necessarily the case! And this applies not just to butter: there are many other examples.  For instance, &quot;Gary wrote for many TV shows&quot; leaves open the possibility of a co-author on the scripts, a possibility that &quot;Gary wrote many TV shows&quot; does not!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Wow! These small changes in semantics (he meaning of a word or phrase) are quite interesting!</line>

				<line>Narrator: if you do not like math then skip this comic (seriously)</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The circuit satisfiability problem is determining if there are some inputs that make the outputs of a circuit &quot;true&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A closely related problem is the formula satisfiability problem, SAP, which can be mapped one-to-one, and in linear time, to the circuit satisfiability problem.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So what does this mean?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If we can solve SAT problems in f(n) time, then circuit-SAT can be solved in 0(n) + f(n) time!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But circuit-SAT can not be solved quickly.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Indeed. Therefore, SAT is as &quot;hard&quot; as circuit-SAT.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Similarly hard problems are &quot;Clique&quot;, &quot;Vertex-Cover&quot; and the Travelling Salesman Problem.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Solving these problems (P) can be accomplished in polynomial time!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Verifying solutions (NP) can also be done in polynomial time!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: In most cases, that&apos;s not balanced at all!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For instance, if you&apos;re doing a story on how the sun is hot (assuming it&apos;s a slow news day), you don&apos;t spend half the story presenting a guy who thinks the sun is cold! You ignore the crazy minority.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But often, when science is reported, equal credence is given to the kooks and their kooky theories! Science is presented as merely an opposing viewpoint.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I concede that, sometimes, it&apos;s nice to be polite! However!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I also believe that it&apos;s NOT nice to be insincere. I am in conflict!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is because there are situations in which being polite implies being insincere. For example, I may think someone looks pretty ridiculous in their fancy new hat, but if they ask me what I think, I&apos;ll try to say SOMETHING positive about it! In order not to hurt their feelings, I am polite in sharing my opinion.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But it&apos;s understood that people will try to be polite, so this insincerity is okay!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If everyone knows people are being insincere, then what&apos;s the point of polliteness? We end up in the same place, semantically speaking.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Not really! Since there is always SOME doubt as to whether someone is just being polite, one can always take something as a compliment!</line>

				<line>Narrator: LOGICAL FALLACY COMICS: today&apos;s fallacy: &quot;THE STRAW MAN&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The &quot;Straw Man&quot; fallacy isn&apos;t so much a fallacy as it is a way of life!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In this fallacy, you present an altered version of your opponent&apos;s argument in order to make it appear absurd! You then tear apart this weaker, ridiculous argument and claim victory. Basically it can be summarized as &quot;make stuff up and attribute it to your opponent&quot;! Haha! EXCELLENT.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What? It&apos;s not excellent, T-Rex! It&apos;s bad argument technique!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: BUT, it&apos;s also a great way to win debates. And if anyone calls you on it, you just say &quot;Come on. Your attack on me is the real straw man fallacy here; let&apos;s be serious.&quot;</line>

				<line>Narrator: COMPRESSED THESIS COMICS: today&apos;s thesis: &quot;Computational Measures of the Acceptability of Light Verb Constructions&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Light verb constructions (LVCs) are constructions like &quot;take a stroll&quot; and &quot;give a smile&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They are formed by combining a light verb (such as &quot;take&quot; and &quot;give&quot;) with a complement (&quot;stroll&quot;, &quot;smile&quot;). Most of the meaning of a (non-idiomatic) LVC comes from the complement (&quot;stroll&quot; and &quot;smile&quot;).</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Amazing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But aren&apos;t some LVCs more acceptable than others? </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes, this is true!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It would be really nice to be able to measure that computationally.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure would! Hmm, I wonder if statistical measures of association would correlate well with human judgement of construction acceptability?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: So, throughout time, people have spent their youth learning, and the time after that applying what they&apos;ve learned. Not a bad system!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ... For a first try!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The problem is that we&apos;re spending longer and longer studyin. If you do a PhD, you could be 30 years old when you graduate! And since there&apos;s so much to know about the world, people are forced to specialize. Even at 30, there just isn&apos;t enough time to learn it all!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s a necessary tradeoff! Millions of people specialize and make tiny contributions to knowledge.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s true!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But what if it didn&apos;t have to be that way? If we lived forever, we could learn so much! We could make connections between completely unrelated fields.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This is true, but the older generation would always remain! If they became stuck in their ways, they might inhibit progress instead of helping.</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  Anger management!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  One must always manage their anger, lest it become under- or even un-managed and therefore out of control!  But we should also remember that emotions aren&apos;t good or bad things - it&apos;s what we do with them that matters.  For instance, anger can help us break things that would otherwise remain unbroken!  Like with...</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  Whenever you feel angry and think maybe you shouldn&apos;t be upset, just repeat to yourself, &quot;Don&apos;t be so angry okay?  Sheesh!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  That&apos;s the most facile anger management technique I&apos;ve ever heard!</line>

				<line>Ye Olde Narratore: The stern voice of Science tells us that these Monstrosi-ties, once having exhausted the Novelty of Death-giving, simply took it as a Matter-of-Course, and paid it little Attenshon, likely dedicating the remainder of their Facu-lities towards some Conversation and Jokery.</line>
				<line>Ye Olde Narratore: Being thus provided with a Compleat exposi-tion of the Dinosaurs, take care, gentle Reader, that you do not deviate from the strait and Upright path set before you by our Father, lest you find thyself in the same Posi-tion as these Beasts, and there be no roome for you on the Ark.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Where does knowledge come from? Does it derive from our obsercations of the world, or could it possibly be... innate?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Let&apos;s settle this question once and for all!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Well, what do you mean by knowledge being innate?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I mean that all knowledge can be derived just by thinking about it!  That it can be deduced from just a few axioms that we all start out with, such as a knowledge of self and an understanding of causality.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This seems like a position one would take only if one wanted to hear one&apos;s own voice, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Not even!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Come on! It only works if you make all sorts of assumptions, like, oh I don&apos;t know, that the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is deterministic and logical!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well perhaps it is!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hey, let&apos;s go flip a coin to decide!  And then we can deduce the outcome by thinking about it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh ho, I&apos;m sorry, is it BITCHY in here?</line>

				<line>Narrator: T-REX IN: PROGRAMMING ADVICE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Are you having trouble programming your computer?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Let me give you a few pointers!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Ooh, ouch.  Was that a bad pun?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It was an... indirect reference?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus:  I suspect that these are all bad puns!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Don&apos;t worry - they&apos;re the least significant bit of my speech. Oh ho!</line>
				<line>Narrator: JOKES EXPLAINED:</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Aren&apos;t pointers programming tools, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They are!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They allow one to reference the address of data, instead of the data itself.  It&apos;s like how knowing someone&apos;s phone number lets you get in touch with them personally!  Hence the delightful &quot;indirect reference&quot; pun.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I too think these are pretty awful.</line>
				<line>Narrator: CONCLUSION:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Everyone!  Program harder!!</line>

		<title>why you got to get all up in my public spaces</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: let us discus public spaces, such as parks and sidewalks! Does nobody own them? Or, are they in fact owned... by everybody?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: An interesting distinction, if I do say so myself!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If nobody is seen as owning a public space, then nobody is motivated to care for it, and so care falls to the government. Spaces become bland and inoffensive, due to the nature of governance! However, if everyone owns them, then everyone can take care of them, and they can become vibrant and challenging.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Challenging how?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Challenging ARTISTICALLY.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: People could put up posters and stuff on telephone poles, along with ads! And anything that anyone didn&apos;t like, they could take down. It would be an anarchic art show or something!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Somehow I don&apos;t see this happening.</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: What&apos;s up?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m working on a group biography about us! But get this: I&apos;m going to bury it when it&apos;s finished, so when it&apos;s discovered, it will be published for SURE. It&apos;ll be historical!</line>

				<line>Narrator: THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD &quot;WOMAN&quot; - IN COMIC FORM!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Many people believe &quot;woman&quot; is a sexist term, due to its apparent base in the word &quot;man&quot;! This has led to crazy alternative spellings like &quot;womyn&quot; and even &quot;wimmen&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: However, this is not the case!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The word originally derives from the old English &quot;wifmann&quot;, where &quot;wif&quot; meant &quot;female&quot; and &quot;mann&quot; meant a person of either sex: thus, a female human!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Man didn&apos;t mean male?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope! It derives from the Latin &quot;humanus&quot; (earthling), from &quot;humus&quot; (earth, soil)!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And while &quot;wif&quot; meant female, &quot;wer&quot; meant male!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We can still see this today in words like &quot;werewolf&quot;, which means, literally, a manwolf.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So &quot;werewolf&quot; is actually a more sexist word than &quot;woman&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: According to me: yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is why I spell the word &quot;wheirwolf&quot;, and why I ask that you do the same! You wouldn&apos;t want to be SEXIST, would you?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: There are some people who identify not as gay or straight or bisexual or what have you, but rather as asexual.  I find this really interesting!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It must be so different!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Some don&apos;t find themselves sexually attracted to anyone, while others do, but find all they want in friendship and have no desire to add kissing to the mix.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: And you find this interesting?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I do, because it&apos;s so far removed from my own experience.  I&apos;m ALL ABOUT adding kissing to the mix! It&apos;s what I do best!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Have you ever met any asexual people, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It&apos;s just - I can&apos;t get over the feeling that you&apos;re treating asexuality like an amusing trinket rather than a real sexual orientation.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well - it&apos;s a fine line! I&apos;m not asexual myself, so there&apos;s a distance between myself and the material.  But I am trying.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s the coolest!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Some pairs (like &quot;prince&quot; and &quot;princess&apos; are complete accepted, while others (like teacher and &quot;teacheress&quot;) seem insanely sexist and out of date. It depends on the word!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Female teachers used to be called &quot;teacheresses&quot;? That&apos;s so bizarre!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know! But maybe one day people will think that about &quot;princesses&quot;. Or MAYBE they&apos;ll wonder how we got by without the word &quot;astronautrix&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The coolest of all these words, though, are clearly those on the threshold of acceptability.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Such as?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, &quot;actress&quot; and &quot;stewardess&quot;, I guess - words which some people will use without hesistation, but which others will call sexist. There&apos;s no consensus!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, I can see the use of &quot;actress&quot;, because the gender of the person affects what roles they can play.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Looks like you&apos;ve come down on the side of &quot;gendered professional nouns have their occasional uses&quot;! </line>

		<title>age of consent / pedophile comics ?</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I find age of consent laws pretty interesting because, for something so basic, they sure vary a lot from place to place!  Again, they&apos;re something for which there is no consensus.  Is that a pun? Consensus?  That wasn&apos;t meant to be a pun.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  ANYWAY!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Most people agree that a 26-year-old should be able to consent to sex, while a child should be protected from sexual predators, but where we legally draw that line is contentious!  Some places allow 12-year-olds to consent to sex, while others believe that even people in their early twenties are unable to give knowledgeable consent to the INTERCOURSE.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This is a pretty dangerous topic, isn&apos;t it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dangerous how?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, isn&apos;t this one of those topics that you&apos;d talk about with friends in private, but not while out in a public place?  You don&apos;t want people to think you&apos;re a PEDOPHILE.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What? I haven&apos;t mentioned anything that would make people say that!  I&apos;m talking about legal ages of consent!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Though... why would I be talking about this if I wasn&apos;t a pedophile? Ah, yes.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Pretty heady stuff!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Anyway, what&apos;s remarkable is that Dante puts both homosexuals and money lenders in the same circle! He thought both were unnatural: interest makes something (money) from nothing (no action on the lender&apos;s part), while homosexuals make nothing (hot gay action doesn&apos;t count!) from something (their reproductive organs).</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hey, how do you know that that&apos;s what Dante was thinking?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s in the book!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It was entirely great!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so Gotham City is infected with zombies, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: People start getting bit, dying, then getting up and feasting on the flesh of the living.  Batman and Robin are fighting them off as best they can, and while they&apos;re too fast and acrobatic to be touched, there&apos;s too many zombies to kill them all.  They start rescuing as many people as they can, taking them to the Batcave for safekeeping.  It&apos;s a good place because it&apos;s not only big, but protected and hidden!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So what happens next?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, soon the Batcave is getting pretty full!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And at some point they&apos;ve rescued this guy who&apos;s been bitten, but who&apos;s hidden it.  He dies, and the next time Batman and Robin come back to the Cave, they find that everyone inside is now a zombie!  Their effort has been entirely futile, and everyone they&apos;ve rescued is dead.</line>

				<line>T-Rex:  That&apos;s right! Phlogiston, bitches!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Phlogiston was proposed as a scientific explanation for combustion!  It was clear that some things burned (like wood), while other things would not burn (like ash).  Phlogiston was a colorless, odourless and weightless substance that was contained in things that could burn.  When they burned, the phlogiston was released into the air!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  That&apos;s a pretty crazy theory!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Yeah, but it totally worked for a while!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  It explained why if you burned things in a jar, they would go out:  the air can only hold so much phlogiston!  But it started to fall apart when people discovered that some things, like magnesium, actually gained mass when burned.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor:  So phlogiston would have to have a negative mass!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  Yeah!  That seemed a little TOO krazy.  But its actually pretty close to what we now believe, only backwards!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: But my plan was to educate! When people called me on &quot;niggardly&quot;, I was going to explain how it most likely derives from the Scandinavian &quot;nig&quot; (miserly), and in fact pre-dates any similar racially-charged words by hundreds of years!</line>

Besides, consider the symbolism of gorging yourself on more food than you actually need: of eating just for eating&apos;s sake.  Gluttony because it&apos;s affordable: what kind of</line>

Plus, you can&apos;t ... such a restaurant ... if you don&apos;t ... cheap, it becomes All-You-Can-Politely-Eat, since you&apos;re trying to impress your date and thus you can&apos;t go all-out.

				<line>T-Rex: Oh, what knowledge we have lost! What revelations were written on those ancient papyrus scrolls, now entirely beyond our grasp? With this lost information, could the industrial revolution have arrived a thousand years earlier? The only answer I can offer is an enthusiastic &quot;perhaps!&quot; followed by a wide-eyed &quot;who knows??&quot;</line>

Certainly SOME ancient knowledge was lost, but I think it&apos;s disingenuous to suggest that its loss meant our development was set back thousands of years!</line>

				<line>Narrator: THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF SCIENCE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This allows us to fashion an empirical and verifiable understanding of the world around us.  Theories are said to be correct if they match up with the observed properties of the universe! However, science makes the tacit assumption that the universe is predictable and orderly and regular, which MAY NOT BE THE CASE.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Okay, but if this is the case, why do you imagine a world for yourself in which people&apos;s ice cream cones can fall in the dirt?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Probably I just want to make things more interesting!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: And I guess all the pain and death in the world is also just to make things more interesting?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That makes me sound pretty messed up, but yeah! I guess!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But you do admit you don&apos;t have control over the entire universe, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I can&apos;t make  you dance, that&apos;s true!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Right! So part of your mind you can&apos;t control (your unconscious) must be at work there. But since you can&apos;t control it, it&apos;s effectively external, right? So the rest of the universe is still external to you! You haven&apos;t gained anything by imagining it&apos;s all in your head.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dude, I gain the knowledge that if I die, the rest of the universe dies with me. Woo hoo!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Utilitarianism is an ethical system in which you always act to minimize pain and increase happiness!  This is the perfect system for me, as I am ALL ABOUT increasing happiness.</line>
				<line>Narrator: UTILITARIANISM COMICS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, I am crushing this house because, holy, what if the people inside are really sad about something? By smushing them, I increase net happiness on the planet over the long term, because they won&apos;t be sad anymore, ALSO, stomping makes me happy.  Net happiness: increased!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I don&apos;t think that&apos;s fair!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We could debate it, but that might make me very sad.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You must realize that this isn&apos;t a fair application of utilitarianism, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I must?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yes! Although, you DO raise some of the fundamental problems with the theory: there&apos;s no pleasure calculus to measure happiness, especially not one that can take into account the long-term consequences of our actions.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I like this phrase, &quot;pleasure calculus&quot;.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex, isn&apos;t the current scientific thinking that the universe will expand forever, but in doing so become a lifeless frozen expanse just above absolute zero due to increases in entropy?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But Dromiceiomimus - infinite time! That means that the possibilities are ENDLESS! There must be a timeframe where we&apos;re all pirates or whatever.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s not necessarily the case, you know.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dude! INFINITE time. Things get CRAZY.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I understand the concept, T-Rex! But while it&apos;s true that things with small probabilities would be guaranteed to occur, things with zero probability still wouldn&apos;t take place, even with infinite time! And I don&apos;t see how you&apos;re going to get around the entropy problem.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so the first secret to being patronizing is to react to everything people do with an aloof amusement, as if it&apos;s so PRECIOUS that they did something all on their own.  Aren&apos;t you just so SPECIAL, Dromiceiomimus?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Nobody wants to be patronized to, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw, sure they do, Dromiceiomimus! Here, let me give you a pat on the head.  You&apos;ve earned it!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: God damn it, you&apos;re making everyone angry.  Why are you even doing this in the first place?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Ewwwwwwwwwwwww!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: That&apos;s so gross, T-Rex! What&apos;d you do?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, I ate it. Problem solved!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Tada!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Ew, T-Rex! You don&apos;t know where that bug has been!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure I do!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know it&apos;s been in my bed.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, but BEFORE that, it could have been anywhere! What if it was a poo bug?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw man, do those exist?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: These bugs aren&apos;t made out of what I think they are, are they?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve decided to write a story about my own team of superheroes. That&apos;s right! They&apos;re called...</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The Incr-- The Fant- The Sweet Dudes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So far I&apos;ve got four people on the team. The first is Justin Time, who has time-based powers! The second is Justin Case, who can control probability. The third is Chix Diggit, who is an attractive dude if I do say so myself, and the last member is Tim Foresnax, who can eat a lot if he wants to! They fight crime and prejudice and have romantic (mis)adventures.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This seems a little derivative, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope! It is 100% my creation!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Come on! &quot;Justin Case&quot;? &quot;Justin Time&quot;? Those are old names that weren&apos;t that funny to begin with.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, Justin Time goes by his middle name, Tehnikov, because having two Justins on the team would be confusing. Get it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Their names sound like common phrases that people might say sometimes! &quot;Just in the nick of time&quot;? Hee hee!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s pretty implausible that someone named &quot;Justin Time&quot; would end up having temporal powers though.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s right, ladies!  I am going to be a dude with direction!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But this isn&apos;t just a ploy to seem more comely to members of the attractive sex!  I really feel like I need a goal to work towards, something that I want to achieve.  In the past I&apos;ve always just gone with the flow!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Go to school, okay, then university, okay, then get a job -</line>

				<line>T-Rex: And then... work at that job or at better jobs as they come along, until I get married and later on die!  THE END.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s &quot;is&quot;!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: These are all pretty boring words, T-Rex. Most are just forms of the same verb!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: YES. Motion passes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Okay! So, um... let&apos;s- fletcherize?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dude, that&apos;s not a conversation! That&apos;s just using a victorian-era verb (which means to chew one&apos;s food thoroughly) without any context!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well - I was asking if you wanted to chew your food thoroughly, that&apos;s all!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: One of the great myths of our time is that the trick to becoming good at something is to practice it over and over.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m afraid that I must respectfully disagree!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: PROOF BY COUNTEREXAMPLE: I have probably practiced eating hundreds of thousands of times! And yet, sometimes I screw it up. Practice clearly hasn&apos;t helped me here, because I should be super awesome at eating things now!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: You screw it up?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I choke! It goes down the wrong tube or whatever. It&apos;s very embarrassing and sometimes I require medical attention.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, to be fair, there&apos;s a difference between practicing eating and just doing many times over many years, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: When you&apos;re practicing, you&apos;re more aware of what you&apos;re doing, examining your own actions actions with an eye for improvement. It&apos;s a focus one dosen&apos;t have while simply eating as a matter of routine.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Perhaps it&apos;s a focus YOU don&apos;t have, dude! You forget that I am extremely intense.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And I can prove it, too! Ask me how my day was.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Time to check up on that utopian society I founded! I bet everything is totally perfect there in Utopia Land.</line>
				<line>Narrator: SOON:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They MOVED?!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My utopian society moved, Dromiceiomimus! They moved away!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What do you mean?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Just that! They packed up everything they could and moved somewhere else, and it&apos;s not somewhere nearby! They clearly thought things would be more utopic if they moved further away from ME. Argh!  I hate those guys so much right now!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But maybe they didn&apos;t move, T-Rex! Maybe they just DISAPPEARED!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: They&apos;re a utopian society, right? But the term &quot;utopia&quot; is a neo-logistic pun in Greek! There, depending on how the word is pronounced (&quot;eu&quot; or &quot;ou&quot;), it means EITHER &apos;good place&apos; OR &apos;no place&apos;. In English the &quot;u&quot; handles both these sounds, so &apos;utopia&apos; actually contains both of these meanings!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s ridiculous! They didn&apos;t phase out of existence for the sake of a pun.  You&apos;re just using this as an excuse to cram an etymology lesson where it doesn&apos;t belong!</line>

I will exploit the expectation that most people only copy images from, and not to, their digital cameras for comedic effect! Tee hee!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Panhandling!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And it&apos;s a tricky issue! Giving money to beggars can be helpful, but some feel it encourages bad behavior and undermines the work of social support organizations. Plus there is always the rumour of beggars who take home hundreds of dollars a day! On the other hand, there may well be people for whom begging is the only means of support they have.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re sure using a lot of qualifiers there, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s intentional!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I really don&apos;t know very much about panhandling, and a lot of people feel really strongly about it. I don&apos;t know! I usually try to learn more about things by doing them, but if I panhandled I&apos;d be a total poseur.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I bet if *I* did it, I&apos;d be way more of a poseur than you!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Does language alter the way we think?  Sources say: perhaps!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This source says: DEFINITELY YES.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think it&apos;s a subtle but pervasive effect!  If a language doesn&apos;t have a word for something, I think I&apos;m less likely to think about whatever it is that word would refer to.  For instance, in English we have words for &quot;friends&quot;, but what if we had a single word for the phrase &quot;friends who deserve pie more often&quot;?  I bet I&apos;d consider buying people more pies!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re saying that if we had words for these things, people would think of them more often?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, I agree, but I think you&apos;re confusing cause and effect!  As things become more prominent, they move to become words.  Like &quot;electronic mail&quot; becoming &quot;e-mail&quot; and finally &quot;email&quot; - that was due to email becoming more popular, not because people were creating the word in order to MAKE IT more popular.  You know?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: ARGH!  I am getting angry just thinking about it!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: It&apos;s not like you to respond so emotionally to something like this, T-Rex!  Why don&apos;t you just respond to their points and disprove their claims?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Because it feels useless!  Because most of these people just want to take on of the most transcendental achievements of our time and belittle it any way they can.  They&apos;re not interested in facts!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Whoah, so instead of attacking the position, we attack the person?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No!  Well, yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t know!  It&apos;s just that we&apos;re in a special place in history now, where it still matters that we&apos;ve been to the moon.  Once moon travel becomes routine people won&apos;t care so much, but right now, the landings are unique.  They&apos;re still special.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How&apos;s that?  You&apos;ve been to the moon like two times yourself!</line>

				<line>Narrator: JOKES EXPLAINED PRESENTS: &quot;CONFUCIUS SAY&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This vaguely-racist form of comedy relies upon the double-entendre!  It narrates the advice of a man called &quot;Confucius&quot; who delivers many a &quot;bon mot&quot;.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example: &quot;Confucius say... man who run in front of car get tired!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ho ho!  Did you catch the comedy there?  There are two meanings in that phrase!  If you don&apos;t get it, don&apos;t worry - the key to emulating understanding is often just to repeat the last word or phrase.  Fake a laugh, say &quot;Hah!  TIRED.&quot; and you will be SET.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Was there a real-life Confucius, T-Rex, or is he merely a convenient fictional device?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: As you know, there was in fact a real Confucius.  He lived in the 5th century in Ancient China (then called &quot;China&quot;) and was and is an incredibly well-respected philosopher!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Indeed!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So yea, you&apos;ve got to be careful, because the real Confucius said many non-hilarious things.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Phrases like &quot;they who know the truth are not equal to those who love it&quot; are not meant to be laughed at!  SO DON&apos;T EVEN TRY.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: To conclude, I hope people needed this joke explained, because otherwise I&apos;ve been hardcore wasting my time today!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Some larger cities are plagued by advertising trucks: trucks paid to just drive around in the downtown core with giant advertising placards mounted on the back.  The hell?  I disagree with this in the strongest way possible!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And generally I&apos;m a seriously easy-going dude!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They&apos;re just so WRONG.  They&apos;re causing unnecessary pollution in an area that already probably has problems with air quality, PLUS, they&apos;re congesting the road and making our cities more corporate and less beautiful.  They&apos;re ugly, and the whole idea is self-centered, and thoughtless, and the worst kind of capitalism.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Oh man, those ad trucks piss ME off too!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Really? You don&apos;t think I&apos;m going overboard?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Not at all!  It&apos;s aggressive advertising that intrudes on our public spaces, and since it adds to congestion on the roads, ACTUALLY MAKES PEOPLE&apos;S LIVES QUANTIFIABLY WORSE.  The time lost stuck behind an ad truck can be traced directly to some jerk who thought his message was more important than minutes from your LIFE.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: My stars, do I ever love documentary films.  The best form of filmmaking?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: As I see it, yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What I&apos;ve come to love is the tension between filmmaker and subject, the way editing can so easily be used to slip the filmmaker&apos;s politics into the film.  The veneer of realism, the claim of legitimacy - ooh!  It&apos;s all so GOOD.  There&apos;s politics in every film, sure, but only documentary makes the claim of truth, and it&apos;s THAT claim that makes it all so interesting.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re still on about documentary film?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dude!  It&apos;s SO GOOD.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My favourite are the extended takes, where you ask your subject a question, they answer it, and then you hold the camera on them for a good ten seconds afterwards while they glance around and look ridiculous.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It is a great way to subtly undermine your subject without saying a word.</line>

		<title>intelligent design comics, featuring: talking dinosaurs coexisting with humans!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Intelligent design (or ID) is the idea that while we may begin to understand the universe through science, it is actually created with divine intent.  Evolution is not the chaotic product of random mutations, but rather intentional.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Much as a watch implies a watchmaker, so does our universe imply divinity!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay!  It&apos;s a very nice idea, but it&apos;s not science because it&apos;s not disprovable: you either believe in intelligent design or you don&apos;t, and there&apos;s no way to show who&apos;s right.  That&apos;s not science - that&apos;s faith!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: And whould faith be held to the rigors of the scientific method?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Of course not!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The issue is that some think ID should be taught in schools as an alternative to evolution, right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Right!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But there&apos;s nothing in ID (as I&apos;ve formulated it) to say that the two can&apos;t exist peacefully.  One just doesn&apos;t belong in science class, because it&apos;s not a science.  It belongs in religion class.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Wait - T-Rex, you claim to hear the voice of God!  What does he say about all this?</line>
				<line>God: I LIKE TO DANCE IN MY UNDERPANTS T-REX</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He says - there&apos;s some merit to both sides of the issue?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Things sure would be different if one day, the speed of light slowed down to something like half a meter per second for some reason.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes indeedy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For one, games of hide-and-go-seek would be more complicated.  Also if you were a long-distance runner, it would be more difficult to run because when you went faster that light you couldn&apos;t see where you were going.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Is that true?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think so.  Maybe?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think you&apos;d still be able to see things, actually!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How&apos;s that?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, light can be thought of as a particle, right?  And so it&apos;s like - if rain was falling really slowly, and you were running throught it, you&apos;d hit more particles than you would if you were standing still.  I think that&apos;s how it would work.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You know what? I&apos;m not even certain if it&apos;s possible to travel faster than light.  I&apos;m going to ask Professor Science.</line>

		<title>learnability of natural languages comics THAT&apos;S RIGHT</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Learning a language is hard!  It is especially hard with your first language, when you&apos;re a baby who has to figure out an entire grammar and vocabulary just from what people say to you.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s not just hard: in fact, it may well be impossible!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It turns out that natural languages are so complex that we probably can&apos;t figure out all their rules just from hearing words spoken around us, but we CAN approximate these rules and get very close.  So the result is we (as learners) end up speaking a language we&apos;re able to communicate with, wut which is slightly different than those that surround us!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How slight a difference are we talking about here?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That depends on the learner, I guess!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Rules that are used everyday are going to be more fixed, because there&apos;s more of a chance somebody will correct you.  But less-frequent parts will be more malleable, which explains why languages evolve so quickly!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Because a language is never passed down, just an approximation of a language.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!  Of course this has changed a little with the advent of grammar books and formal schooling, but it&apos;s still there.  For example, I might think the word &apos;tenet&apos; is enraging!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Oh goodness, cryptography.  It&apos;s really interesting!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Specifically, trapdoor functions are SUPER interesting!  Times two!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: These are functions that are easy to compute but difficult to reverse-engineer - unless you have the secret &apos;trapdoor&apos; information.  For example, the product of two prime numbers (p and q) is not hard to figure out if you know their values (it&apos;s just multiplication!), but if all you have is the answer, n, guessing what p and q are can take a really long time.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And yeah, functions like this are a basis of cryptography!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How&apos;s that?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, say I send n to you, and you know what the secret value of p is.  There&apos;s a chance my message might be intercepted by a bad guy.  But this dude will only know n, not p!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So I&apos;ll be able to figure out q easily, knowing what n and p are, but this guy will be totally stumped!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!  Of course, all this lets us do is communicate a prime number q in secret to each other.  But you can probably do even more things with trapdoor functions!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Could it be you have a CRUSH on flappers, my friend?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It could well be, Utahraptor!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And it doesn&apos;t concern you that you have a crush on an extinct social group just because of their sweet slang?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope! It gives me hope, because one day I could meet someone who actually talked like a flapper, and then we could get married!</line>
				<line>Narrator: A FEW YEARS LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Man, what was I talking about? It was a terrible idea to marry someone just because of her cool slang!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I really need to think long and hard about my life decisions.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: We&apos;ve probably all been there.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hey, I&apos;ve got a great idea, T-Rex: let&apos;s get tattoos together!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Like twin tattoos?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: No, like we both get tattoos at the same time - for moral support.  Twin tattoos? You were thinking we&apos;d each get separate halves of the yin yang symbol or something?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah, I guess I was!  Hah hah! That WOULD be pretty crazy.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We&apos;d have to press our tattoos together to make them line up and all the people would think we&apos;re married!  Plus what if we got the tattoos on our lips?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Hahahah! You get knocked down, but you get up again!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I have discovered a new philosophy for life that appeals to my own sense of self-worth!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Egoism!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In egoism, all your actions are motivated by a desire to make things easy for one person: yourself! For instance, I crush this house because it&apos;s in my way. My actions are justified, thanks to egoism!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But what about yourself? You&apos;re only here because your parents selflessly decided to have children. Your very existence is against egoism.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They probably realized what a great dinosaur I&apos;d be and figured it would be in their own interests to creat me!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What the hell?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: First off, I don&apos;t know why you need egoism to justify the destruction you&apos;re going to wreak ANYWAY. Second off, egoism doesn&apos;t account for charity, unless you reduce it to &apos;good will in the bank&apos;, saved for some future benefit. That in turn doesn&apos;t account for charity seen in lesser animals, who aren&apos;t cognizant of such self-centered account-keeping. In conclusion: it&apos;s untenable.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Is it possible to have too many friends?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The answer is &quot;Definitely yes!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is because if you were friends with EVERYONE ever in the history of time, you&apos;d have so many people who&apos;d expect you to talk with them on the phone and hang out with them and stuff, and there&apos;s only so many hours in a day! Eventually you&apos;d end up snubbing at least SOME of them, which is bad.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Therefore, yes, it is possible to have too many friends!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You know, talking like this risks backlash, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How so?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, few people worry about having too many friends, and those who feel like they could maybe use some more friends might become resentful.  It&apos;s not the sort of thing you go looking for sympathy about.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t have too many friends! I was speaking hypothetically!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I could use some more friends, actually.  I tried calling an escort service once but it turns out that is a euphemism and all the people there were just interested in sex for money!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Yep! It&apos;s not going to be that big of a party, but I thought people might be in high demand, so I&apos;m asking now.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I - I guess I don&apos;t have any other plans!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Huh! That was weird!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What was?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus invited me to a party like two months in advance! But - more weird was that I was actually musing about not wanting to be prematurely invited to any parties just before she spoke to me. It&apos;s incredible.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s so unlikely. It&apos;s such a weird thing to worry about.</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: What?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: And why are you stomping the girl?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nostalgia.</line>

You are going to be a normal t-rex, and I am going to be a normal billionaire Canadian hair model.

				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so - </line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Murder is wrong!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Wait - was I just saying that it is objectively and verifiably true that murder is always wrong? That&apos;s a pretty big statement.Or was I merely saying that it&apos;s the societal consensus of most that murder is not such a good idea? Maybe it&apos;s an emotional statement, saying &quot;I&apos;m against murder, personally&quot;. Or MAYBE it&apos;s more of an imperative, better phrased as &quot;Don&apos;t murder!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: We&apos;ve built a whole system around ethics and you&apos;re questioning its foundation!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s right, baby!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: And we never will! What&apos;s to be gained from arguing fine semantic points of justifying MURDER?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s a world where everyone knows how they&apos;re going to die!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You can go in to a doctor and he takes a blood test, and then his machine spits out a piece of paper that says &quot;exploded&quot; or &quot;drowned&quot; or &quot;poisoned apple&quot; and that&apos;s it.  No dates, no details!  And so people who are to die from drowning spend their lives avoiding swimming pools, but they end up drowning anyway.  Part of the fun would be seeing how!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: This story sounds pretty morbid, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Morbidly INTERESTING!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: True!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I guess the only safe one would be if the paper said &quot;old age&quot;.</line>

Einstein spoke his last words in German, but the only person present didn&apos;t speak the language, so his last words are lost. That&apos;s actually pretty neat, I think! I could learn some obscure language before I die and use that as a backup plan.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: So not only are HeLa cells the first observed example of devolution or speciation in human beings (going from a multi-celled life form to a singe-celled one) but they&apos;re also maybe a first example of immortality: her cells live, but the woman from whom the cells were taken, Henrietta Lacks, died from this cancer in 1951. That&apos;s crazy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Crazier: there&apos;s probably a greater mass of HeLa cells now than there was of Henrietta when she was alive!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The whole thing is so surreal, don&apos;t you think? The woman made a huge contribution to society just by getting sick. And imagine a new species EVOLVING from your body?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, Henrietta never found out. She was never even told that the cells were being cultivated!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And with that, I exhaust all my knowledge of Henrietta and HeLa cells. I am well and truly tapped.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The cells are called &quot;helacyton gartleri&quot;.</line>

				<line>Narrator: THAT EVENING:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ARGH! I had hoped to avoid this realization, but it&apos;s inescapable: I hate the mall! I know it&apos;s a cliched thing to hate but it&apos;s TRUE.  I hate the crowds and the cell phones and I hate the music and the consumerism and the shops that don&apos;t have anything that I want. And I didn&apos;t hate but I really disliked the burger I purchased in the food court.  It had no toppings. Also it was very dry.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re becoming a generic stand-up comedian!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m not! I just feel their pain!</line>

But then again, there&apos;s nothing wrong with finding some feature particularly fetching, and maybe all the Asian women he meets just happen to have this feature.

				<line>T-Rex: Begging the question is when what you&apos;re trying to prove is assumed implicitly in one of your premises!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: FOR EXAMPLE: T-Rex is a pretty sweet dude because he&apos;s always so friggin&apos; awesome!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is actually formally valid: if the premise is true and I&apos;m friggin&apos; awesome, then it follows that I&apos;m a pretty sweet dude.  However, I&apos;ve provided no logical support for my &quot;T-Rex is awesome&quot; premise, but only made a conclusion (T-Rex = pretty sweet) which relies on the premise being true.  I haven&apos;t offered any evidence, so I am begging the question!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But &quot;begging the question&quot; is mostly used today to mean &quot;raising the question&quot;!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know!  IT&apos;S SO WRONG.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, I suppose that begs the question, T-Rex: if it&apos;s used more often to mean &quot;raises the question&quot; than &quot;a fallacy of presumption&quot;, doesn&apos;t that suggest that the definition of the phrase has evolved?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: NO IT DOES NOT.  What it suggests is that everybody sucks but me!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve never had any problems with dating someone of a different religion, but I imagine under certain circumstances it could be a problem!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Much like... most things?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I guess if there was some religious beliefs that one person had and the other didn&apos;t, it could lead to tension, but relationships are about compromise, right? But if someone, say, adopts the actions of a religion as a compromise, but not the beliefs behind it, isn&apos;t that just going through the motions, which isn&apos;t really what most religions are about?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I guess a lot of it depends on the faith of the people involved, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How so?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, if you REALLY believe that by not sharing your religion, your partner is harming himself somehow (i.e., comdemning himself to a sucky afterlife), then you&apos;d want to help him out, right? I could see that leading to tension, since there&apos;s not much room for movement there unless one of you softens your views.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s true! Luckily, as I say, this has never happened to me. Therefore, double high fives for conflict avoided??</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m not giving you double high fives, T-Rex.</line>

				<line>NArrator: an educational installment</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Vitamin B12: What is it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is important to good health.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It helps maintain healthy nerve and red blood cells, and is also needed to make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What foods provide vitamin B12?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Beef liver, fish, eggs, and milk, among others.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What is the health risk of too much vitamin B12?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Vitamin B12 has a very low potential for toxicity.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Vegetarians who do not eat meats, fish, eggs, milk or milk products are at high risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Individuals with stomach and small intestinal disorders may not absorb enough vitamin B12 from food to maintain healthy body stores.</line>

Then you&apos;ve got your vegans, who don&apos;t eat meat or ANY animal products, so eggs, honey, milk, and cheese are out, and even leather sometimes. For - for shoes.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: And pants?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: My favorite are the freegans!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Where you be vegetarian for free?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Close! It&apos;s where you don&apos;t eat meat unless you&apos;re given it for free, like from a dumpster. You prevent meat from going to waste, but you don&apos;t support its production.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That sounds close to flexitarians, who only eat meat when being vegetarian would be rude or inconvenient!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Now, I myself am a tremendo-meatatarian, which means that I only eat meat that I find to be tremendously delicious! </line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Don&apos;t what?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Don&apos;t believe that video games can be judged by the same standards as films.  It&apos;s the Devil again.  I think he&apos;s trying to convince me to play a video game with him where you don&apos;t get to move.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: So the questions is:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Who am I?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Since an individual can &quot;evolve&quot; over time, what makes them a person at all?  Is there no connection between myself as a child and myself now, besides the fact that we share a (now post-pubescent) body?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What is the point about worrying about the Self if the Self is in a constant state of change?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Why should we bother assigning an identity to what is essentially one frame of a constantly-changing motion picture.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: T-Rex!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think you are overanalyzing this.  People change, that is part of life.  Just because we&apos;re in a state of gradual evolution doesn&apos;t mean we have no identity; indeed, that identity is probably what&apos;s guiding the evolution.</line>

In doing so, they accelerate their pollen at rocket speeds and blast it out at over four meters per second. That&apos;s some fast pollen! And I am not a dude who&apos;s gonna say that naturally weaponized flowers aren&apos;t cool.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The first is to go further in something than anyone has before!</line>

Simply think of something people already do, then think of a reasonable limit to that activity, and THEN shoot past it!

				<line>Utahraptor: No!  I didn&apos;t mean to.  I was just wondering if you thought everyone wants to be unique, or if some can be satisfied with just a simple life, quietly well lived.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, I suppose the idea of remarkability ties in with a desire for fame, which I SUSPECT is merely a corruption of wanting to be respected.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So yeah!  I can see wanting to be respected but not wanting to be remarkable - it almost seems nobler than otherwise.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Hey, God, would you still hang out with me if I didn&apos;t have any friends?</line>
				<line>God: HAHA NOPE</line>
				<line>Narrator: WHAT IF I HAD NO FRIENDS COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: starring t-rex the dinosaur</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m serious!  I figure it&apos;s harder to make that first friend than it is to make the 20th, and I&apos;m concerned that if I moved to a new town where I didn&apos;t know anybody, I wouldn&apos;t have any friends.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: You&apos;re good at making friends though, T-Rex!  You&apos;re not shy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But that&apos;s just it &quot;#8212; I&apos;m just not shy among FRIENDS!  It is a catch 22 in my social life!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, how did you make friends the first time?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t remember, man!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I must have been two years old or something.  But I&apos;ve used that first friend as a seed to get me all my other friends and now I have this irrational fear that my house of cards will come crashing down around me!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hah!  Looks like you&apos;d better be EXTRA nice to us then!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Wait.  Wait &quot;#8212; I have the solution!  All we have to do is make a legally binding promise to be best friends forever, purely out of fear of being alone!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: T- That&apos;s attractive, right?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I am no longer worried about not having any friends if I move to a new town.  I have turned a crisis into an opportunity!  An opportunity...</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ... for personal reinvention!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The key is that nobody will know me in this new town, which means I could be whomever I want!  If I present myself as a grizzled prospector, no one will be able to say otherwise!  I could be a race car driver!  I could be a LIBRARY SCIENTIST.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But - you couldn&apos;t get a job at a library, bceause you wouldn&apos;t ACTUALLY know library science.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But I could pretend!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So you&apos;d move to a new town just to start a life of LIES?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I mean no!  It wouldn&apos;t be lying: it would be REINVENTION.  I would be the Star Trek: The Next Generation to my present &quot;original series&quot;.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But instead of androids you&apos;d have prospectors, and fake librarians.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!  In all seriousness, it would let me put behind myself aspects of my past that I&apos;m not happy with.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Like chocochops?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Like everything I&apos;ve EVER DONE WRONG OH GOD</line>

				<line>Utahraptor:  What about people who are named for their species?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  It&apos;s alright!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  I kind of wish my name was a verb, too, though, instead of just being a noun. You can&apos;t T-Rex something.  I&apos;ve tried.  It doesn&apos;t work.</line>

				<line>Narrator: MORE REGRET</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I regret spilling a glass of ginger ale on an architect!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I regret the first time I met someone with a thick accent: she was older than I, and we had a little trouble communicating initially, because of the accent. But as I repeated myself to her I found myself unintentionally speaking both slowly AND loudly. I only did it for a little while, and as soon as I realized it I stopped, but I still felt ashamed. I was talking to her like she was dumb, just because of the accent! I was the stereotypical ignorant racist.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw MAN! Dromiceiomimus wins the regret competition AGAIN!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: We&apos;re out of our league!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We need to do some Olympic-class screw ups and feel REALLY bad about them if we&apos;re ever going to win.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I know, I know! But it seems she&apos;s got a regret for every occasion. How can we compete with that?</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER, PROFANELY SPYING ON DROMICEIOMIMUS:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: She&apos;s just sadly staying at home, Utahraptor! Man! She&apos;s probably regretting things RIGHT NOW!</line>

		<title>a history of hysteria</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Hysteria was once thought to originate in the womb (&quot;hystera&quot; is the Greek word for &quot;womb&quot;). This had the nice side-effect of making men immune to it!</line>
				<line>Narrator: A HISTORY OF HYSTERIA</line>
				<line>It was thought to be caused by the malfunction, or sometimes just the presence, of the uterus. Women were crazy because their wombs were so wacky! People went as far to suggest that women should not be taught, because enlarging the brain would shrink the womb, making them useless as mothers and even MORE hysterical. Treatment sometimes included genital massage!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You sure know a lot about the history of hysteria, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s true!</line>
				<line>And it&apos;s why I never call a woman OR a joke &quot;hysterical&quot;. I don&apos;t want to be accused of tacitly endorsing historically institutionalized sexism!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hah! I might accuse you of that just for fun.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw, MAN!</line>
				<line>Narrator: T-REX DECIDES TO EXCISE THE &quot;HYSTERA&quot; ROOT ENTIRELY FROM HIS VOCABULARY, JUST TO BE SAFE:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So I hear you&apos;re having a minuswomb operation?</line>
				<line>Off-panel stranger: Excuse me? I&apos;m having a hysterectomy.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I saw the greatest TV show last night.  It ruled!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It SUCKED!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I am using the second &quot;it&quot; to refer to my entire experience watching the show, of course, and not to the show in particular.  The program was exactly the sort of thing I had long wanted to see on television!  I HAD vaguely sort of planned to maybe try my hand at writing television, but there&apos;s no point now, because the talent behind last night&apos;s episode have accomplished all that I would have like to have done. THANKS TELEVISION INDUSTRY.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I would like to extrapolate this up to the societal level!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Please do!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: WELL!  Things are great for society but it sort of sucks for the individual, because we can flawlessly record and cheaply reproduce all transcendent artistic work.  So as an artist, you no longer have to be the best in your village, you have to be the best in the world!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But - I suppose it&apos;s not quite as bad as all that, since different people DO have different tastes.  What was the name of this show you liked so much?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Babies Sporting Monocles&quot;?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Nothing beats a relaxing day of stomping humans and their tiny accessories.  Especially for a T-Rex such as myself.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Some day all of this carnage and destruction is going to catch up with you.  Perhaps even in the unlikely form of the destruction of our universe, and its replacement with an eerily similar one.</line>

				<line>Narrator: POETS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I have been trying, UNSUCCESSFULLY, to write a poem for the past half hour.  I am trying to capture the emotion of getting up early in winter, during a heavy snowfall, and going for a walk and coming across a set of traffic lights (the kind that switch automatically) controlling traffic that isn&apos;t there, traffic that won&apos;t be there for hours.  The sense of seeing them as art, of watching them through the snowfall in the crisp dusk of a new day.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So let&apos;s hear what you&apos;ve written so far!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay, but I warn you: it is unfinished.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Once upon a time / Some traffic lights did time / Colours on the snow / Where oh where did they all go?&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hah hah!  That is definitely the worst poem I&apos;ve heard all day.</line>

To fall in love is to value another person&apos;s happiness above your own to want to be with them and make your lives together the bet they could possibly be. Are you saying you would not like to love and be loved? Of course you would. Your partner is out there looking for you.  You should probably get on this.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: You are diluting our message here, UTAHRAPTOR.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m serious! People get son hung up on finding &quot;the one&quot; that they forget everything else.  You  can have an entirely rewarding life without being &quot;so madly in love&quot; with someone! Close friendships and a private room can offer most of the things love does.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: You know, I have no idea!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe they do, but they&apos;re just super spicy pills, so people&apos;s eyes well up when they bite into them. Anyway!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Anyway! I&apos;ve seen you cry at movies.</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: I don&apos;t know - I&apos;m really not comfortable with such intent towards love! It all seems so calculating and shrewd somehow.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s simply directing my self-development towards an end result I imagine my target would be happy with, as if to say, &quot;how about now?&quot;</line>

				<line>Utahraptor:  How&apos;s that?</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  For your information, I have read SEVERAL websites on the subject.</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  For instance, did you know that whenever women are alone they have pillow fights, and then they practise kissing on each other?  I&apos;ve seen the pictures!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: My brain is flooding with new ideas and concepts!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This cabin for example, represents the great works of mankind.  My foot symbolizing a Derridesque deconstruction, forever driving a wedge between the artist and his creation.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What are you doing? You&apos;ve already destroyed one universe!</line>

				<line>Narrator: EPIPHANY COMICS</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Friends are good things to have! They can help you out when you are sad (a psychological benefit), and can lend you money if you need it (an economic benefit)!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It is these positive benefits of having friends that concern me!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m pretty sure I like my friends because of the people they are, but what if I&apos;m just kidding myself? What if I really just like them because they&apos;re an economic cushion - someone to bail me out, even literally, if I get into trouble?</line>
				<line>Dromiciomimus: Well - I mean, you&apos;d do the same thing for us, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exactly! We hedge our bet by having friends!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: There are friendships that go beyond this shared benefit, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: How so?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Okay - what about &quot;best friends forever&quot;, the people in your life who you&apos;ll know will stand by you no matter what?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They are even MORE of an economic benefit! They are get out of jail free cards, people who you can rely on in any situation.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Wait!! My problem&apos;s that I&apos;m seeing any positive effect of friendship as income, and thus everyone involved in one as compromised in a conflict of interest. I would only be happy if having friends was awful! Thanks, rare and brilliant moments of perfect self-awareness!</line>

		<title>you can be against terrorism AND also against the phrase &apos;intellectual terrorism&apos;, OKAY</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I learnt a new phrase today!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;Intellectual terrorism!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &quot;I first thought it was a ridiculous phrase, both on its own and with all the phrases it suggested, like &quot;emotional terrorism&quot; and &quot;pseudo-intellectual terrorism&quot;. But if ideas are powerful, then maybe you can terrorize someone with them! Maybe? Then again, &quot;intellectual terrorism&quot; comes very close to saying that ideas I disagree with or find distasteful are wrong, and worse, damaging and weaponized. Whatever, intellectual terrorism!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: How&apos;d you hear a phrase like that?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In just the way you&apos;d think!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Someone didn&apos;t like what they were reading, so they defined its contents as &quot;terrorism&quot;. I think they were serious.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It does sort of suggest that if someone said just the right words to you, you&apos;d become instantly paralyzed with a life-shattering fear.</line>
				<line>Narrator: BACKSTORY: SUCH A PHRASE EXISTS FOR T-REX, AND PEOPLE HAVE COME CLOSE TO SAYING IT IN THE PAST:</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I will clean it up REALLY well. I will mop the floors! I will mop the walls or whatever. I will tear the house down and REBUILD it, metaphorically speaking. I&apos;m illustrating this metaphor by literally stomping on this house!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: That&apos;s very apt, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Thanks!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And - your metaphor includes stomping on women, somehow?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For you see, the woman represents years of build-up of grime and dirt. By stomping on her I illustrate cleaning power - not of any household cleaner, but of simply applying yourself!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: So it&apos;s like a pet, but instead of being cute, it pollutes?</line>

NO THANKS.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So you&apos;re not going to do either of those things today?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I have started a radio show! It is an advice show. People can call me and I will give them advice on all of their problems, from being locked out of their house to being EMOTIONALLY locked out of their house in a RELATIONSHIP.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I call it, &quot;I Know! I&apos;ll Ask T-Rex About My Stupid Problems!&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomomimus: Do you think people will call into a show with that title, T-Rex? They&apos;d be, you know, tacitly admitting that their problems are stupid.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is a good thing! Stupid problems, like &quot;I bought too much mayonnaise&quot;, are easy to solve. (The solution is to give away, return, or consume the extra mayonnaise.)</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But what if people call in with real problems?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Easy: my mom answers them!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We&apos;re going to team up. I&apos;ll answer the silly questions, and there&apos;ll be a feature called &quot;Ask T-Rex&apos;s Mom&quot;, where she&apos;ll answer all the hard questions. Moms are really good at things like that.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s a really charming answer!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER, RECORDING &quot;ASK T-REX&apos;S MOM&quot;!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: They&apos;re still in the ground, so they last for years! Tada!</line>

All the women were totally topless and all the men wore body paint and hunted with spears! Life was good in the forest!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Primitivism has this strange semi-positive racism attached to it too.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Semi-positive?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah! You exaggerate traits as you often do with racism, but you make them positive things instead of negative. Natives were better because they were all stoic and noble and loved Mother Nature. Okay, great, but what if you&apos;re native and you&apos;re not like that?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: BUT, none of them are so tough or so smart as to not be afraid of death (here we are ignoring sage Buddhist dudes who are probably not actually afraid of death). So! In a state of nature, everyone wants to avoid being killed, and so will defend themselves when faced with death. But since we need resources like food and water to live, and they&apos;re not infinite, we are constantly warring with one another for access to them.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Everyone is fighting everyone in and ENDLESS BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And the only way out?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s for us to realize that war sucks (it makes us die too), and so to give up a little of our freedom in exchange for an ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY who will ensure internal peace and common defence. Tada!</line>

CONCLUSION: a lot of people must be faking it!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Hey, can we segue this into talking about disabilities?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure, I guess!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ALTHOUGH, I&apos;d rather if we didn&apos;t. There&apos;s a lot of issues and politics around disabilities (can deafness be something to be proud of? What do you make of strangers who volunteer to push you in your wheelchair?), and I&apos;d rather not get involved in the debate via my being &quot;super tall&quot;.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Okay nevermind!</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: SOCIoLOGICAL THEORY: We, as a people, have lost the &quot;big picture&quot;, worrying more about problems at home than problems that affect us on a planetary scale! We have lost a sense of global purpose. And I have proof!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Proof in the form of lyrics from POPULAR MUSIC, baby!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What makes you think this, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Popular music! I just said. Popular music. Because in the 60s it was all, &quot;everyone around the world, join hands&quot;, but recently, it&apos;s all &quot;people in the house, say &apos;wayoooh&apos;&quot; or whatever. We are singularly focused on rooms in houses and have forgotten the rest of the world! Theory: incontestably proven?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Theory: probably just an attempt to somehow pick up chicks by T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No way dude!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My theory is both funny AND accurate, and I believe you diss stems from the fact that you&apos;re JUST JEALOUS of how I pick up chicks with my fine, fine theories.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What chick? Where are all the chicks? We&apos;re two dudes and we&apos;re alone!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I told you before! THEIR CAR BROKE DOWN. The chicks were all coming to hang out with me in the same car to save on gas, and it broke down. That is what happens to cars sometimes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Even chicks are subject to ENTROPY, man.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Wait, I&apos;m a brilliant psychologist! ALL COMFORT COMES FROM THE WOMB!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: People find hugs comforting because it reminds them of the tight squeeze of the womb! My kisses are popular because they remind people of amniotic fluid in the womb.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I think you may be doing something wrong if your kisses remind people of amniotic fluid, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Perhaps! But that is a topic for ANOTHER TIME</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What about people who came from eggs? Like, for example, EVERY DINOSAUR EVER.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Right, right!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, I think my points are still valid. I don&apos;t know about you, but I do sleep in the &quot;egg fetus&quot; position.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The odds are that SOMEONE I know will be a victim of theft or crime or an accident or even violence, and that sucks, because there&apos;s basically nothing I can do to stop it!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: You COULD stop it if you had absolute dominion over time and space, T-Rex.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Are you planning to sell these bags to people who want to turn every laundry day into a chance for arrest, AND ALSO to those nostalgic for the charming visual shorthands of early cartoons?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I am indeed! Or at least, I was indeed, until I realized that you could just make your own with just a little fabric paint and a working knowledge of what dollar signs looks like. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I actually think this has been done before, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw man, really?</line>

				<line>T-Rex Only, I wasn&apos;t a regular cockfighter, who battles his animals against those of an opponent.  It was with turkeys instead of chickens, and rather than fighting each other, I raced my own turkey around the countryside.  Halfway through the race we started fighting - I would punch and the turkey would hop up and peck me.  I remember holding back my punches a bit because I didn&apos;t want to be known as the kind of dude who would punch out a turkey.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: All I&apos;ll need to do is ask old people about their lives, and measure how many of them regret certain things! This &quot;regret index&quot; will range from 0 (no regret) to 1 (total ultimate regret).

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I have gained provisional access to a shortwave radio!  Last night I was flipping around and discovered a NUMBERS STATION.  Question: how excellent is that?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Answer: TOTALLY EXCELLENT??</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you&apos;re unfamiliar with them, Dromiceiomimus, number stations are radio stations that play pre-recorded voices reciting long strings of numbers, often with a short musical cue beginning or ending the segments.  They are encoded communication often meant for spies, encrypted using one-time pads!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Neat!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I KNOW.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I love that I live in a world where I can hear actual secret messages for spies!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What are they like?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Entertaining and affecting and surreal.  Man!  Can you imagine waking up one day and finding that all the radio stations have been replaced by a little girl&apos;s voice reading out endless strings of numbers?  It would be GREAT.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And menacing.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And GREAT.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It would be like, &quot;Hey, I wonder what&apos;s on the radio?  Oh, it&apos;s &apos;39398 32348 59378 70636&apos;!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yep!  That&apos;s what it would be like!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And then the dude would be like, &quot;IT&apos;S TOO AWESOME MY MIND IS BREAKING&quot;?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything wrong ever again.  Evidentialism</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Therefore, I won&apos;t believe in things like faith healing, because there&apos;s no room for faith in evidentialism!  I also don&apos;t believe there&apos;s convincing evidence for anyone having kissed someone SO HARD that both people exploded, so I will have to regretfully concede that I don&apos;t believe that&apos;s happened yet either. But, at least I won&apos;t believe in anything I can&apos;t prove!  Thanks, evidentialism!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But - how do you know to believe your evidence, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dude! It&apos;s EVIDENCE.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, but this evidence must need justification to be believed.  So evidence requires its own evidence, and so you have an infinite chain of proof.  This spells disaster for you my friend!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A valid attack, perhaps strengthened by the old &quot;What if we&apos;re all just brains in jars&quot; question!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: BUT!  What if I switch my beliefs to foundationalism, in which I mark a few beliefs as &quot;foundations&quot; I consider to be &quot;self-evident&quot;?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Then you have abandoned evidence for faith!</line>

				<line>God: WHAT</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Like I said! The universe and God are the exact same thing!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We all get to be divine, Dromiceiomimus! Better, everything I do is an act of God! Right now, THIS aspect of God wants to stomp on this other, more housey aspect of God.</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: T-Rex, you&apos;re just redefining &quot;God&quot; to mean &quot;existence&quot;!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Attention Men!  Are you a man?  Here are some tips!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Tip 1: Grooming is important!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  This means that you have to shower and if you always wake up with food on your face then you have to understand that you have a problem.  We all have problems, but yours is that you go to sleep beside bowls of wet salad and then in your sleep, you tip over the bowl.  You need to work on that.  I don&apos;t know what to tell you.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Tip 2: prostate exams: apparently important?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Apparently prostate exams are pretty important!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Tip 3: In some situtations, like truck stops, manliness is measured by virility, so you may wish to boast of sexual conquests.  But in other situations (job interviews), it&apos;s measured by problem solving skills and your ability to work in groups!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: True men can easily distinguish between such situations.</line>
				<line>Narrator: TIPS FOR WOMEN</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I think that comedy goes bad after a while!  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve EVER laughed at a joke that&apos;s more than two hundred years old.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Screw you, comedy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s not just that jokes get dated, but that whole standards for comedy shift, I think.  Stuff that was edgy fifty years ago is old hat today!  We can recognize HOW it was supposed to be funny, but there&apos;s comedic writing from a hundred years ago that goes right over our heads today, simply because we don&apos;t have the cultural context to recognize that jokes are being made, that parody and satire are taking place.  Ouch for those guys!  Ouch for us in 200 years!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, most everything changes with time, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I guess!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But I think comedy changes more than most.  We can read serious writing from centuries ago and the arguments are WAY more accessible than any jokes.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I guess that&apos;s true, but I&apos;m sure there are also &quot;stupid people do stupid things&quot; jokes that are pretty timeless.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh man, I never told you!  One time, I saw a stupid guy nobody likes eating too many bananas!!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay, so perhaps there ARE those who find old jokes in old books to be hilarious, and we just happen to have different senses of humour! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE TO GENERALIZE ACROSS EVERY LIVING THING THAT CAN LAUGH, AND ALSO READ.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This I do concede!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But, I still think that it&apos;s true that, given a random joke from the present and one from the past, the average person will be more likely to laugh at the present joke, just because they have more context. I&apos;m convinced present-day jokes about airplane food will fade in cultural relevance and become less funny as airplanes are replaced by HoverPants!</line>

For example, your well-known satisfaction at eating cereal in the morning is an exact, identifiable, reproducible joy that I can only label &quot;breakfast pleasure.&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Has this strapping young dinosaur perhaps become a little... COMPLACENT?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s time to go traveling!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is because travel beats complacency if you do it right!  When you&apos;re traveling as a backpacker, outside of the regular tourism industry, you&apos;re off the beaten path AND doing a lot of new things all on your own.  You meet new people and, since you&apos;re put in an environment where you&apos;re probably less comfortable than you usually are (both literally and figuratively), you&apos;re in a prime situation for self-discovery as well!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So you&apos;d rather do your own thing than go on a big tour with a travel agency?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Absolutely!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But - I mean, I know it&apos;s not entirely a positive thing.  All tourism can change the areas it touches!  My role as a backpacker COULD be seen as an advance scout for the larger tourism industry - and if I find something wonderful, odds are others will soon follow.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So what&apos;s the solution?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t know, man!  Stop traveling?  Encase unspoiled areas in amber?  Use spaceships to colonize new planets and therefore delay the issue until there are no new frontiers?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That last one sounds pretty awesome!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s cause it&apos;s got rockets!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Maybe &quot;cheapened&quot; is too strong a word, but it&apos;s now - routine? Predictable? Now if we&apos;ve made a big mistake we can&apos;t say &quot;My God! What have I done?&quot; because it&apos;s too clich?: we either have to acknowledge that or reach for another way to express it.

		<title>this was going to be a comic about how people nowadays seem unable to accept that you can write a fictional story even if it hasn&apos;t actually happened to you, but then i got way into the totally awesome retarded premise</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I am writing the best story ever!  In it, I simply APPROPRIATE a popular novel, and then place its author in a generalized version of its premise!  THEN, the author has eerily familiar, but thoroughly modernized,adventures.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So, it&apos;s like, H.G. Wells actually has a time machine that he uses for wacky escapades!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And then he goes back in time to meet Edgar Allan Poe, who actually IS haunted by the supernatural and has a creepy raven in his study, next to the silken sad uncertain rustling of his purple curtains.  After picking up Mary Shelley, they ALL go forward in time and meet Patricia Highsmith, who is surrounded by morally compromised antihero neighbours!  Then they all go on a train ride and have an adventure.  </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Then what happens?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: THEN, my friend, the story writes itself!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And at the end, all the characters high five each other and go home to their own times, promising to write their own versions of what happened.  Then, they all write their most famous works!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Huh!</line>
				<line>Narrator: MUCH LATER: </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Edgar Allan Poe!  What are YOU doing here?</line>
				<line>Edgar Allan Poe: I&apos;m just chillin&apos; on your couch, T-Rex!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Edgar Allan Poe! You are so needy.</line>
				<line>Edgar Allan Poe: When you call me &quot;needy&quot;, T-Rex, you make me feel like I&apos;m crazy, just because I want to spend time with you! That&apos;s not crazy: that&apos;s what friends do. If you don&apos;t want to be friends with me then we should talk about that, but if you do, then you need to spend more time with me.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Edgar! We&apos;re spending time together RIGHT NOW! That counts! It HAS TO count if you follow me around.</line>

Like, you could have been a great soccer player if only you&apos;d practiced when you were a kid.

				<line>T-Rex: I wonder what the most important day of my life is? Yesterday? Tomorrow? Maybe even...</line>
				<line>T-Rex: TODAY???</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It could be that I wouldn&apos;t even recognize the importance of the day until years down the line - like, if today is the day I come across an abandoned violin and ten later I discover that I&apos;m actually seriously excellent at playing sonatas, and then I become famous for playing sonatas. That would have a huge effect on my life, and TODAY COULD BE THAT DAY. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What if today really IS your most important day, and nothing memorable happens? </line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw man!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If that is the case, then I would be sorely disappointed. I&apos;m serious! I would be so disappointed that I would start to get physically sore. </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The next morning you&apos;d get up and say, &quot;Ouch! I must have been disappointed a little TOO MUCH yesterday! I&apos;ll have to go easy on the disappointment for a while!&quot;</line>
				<line>Narrator: ANYWAY! T-REX&apos;S MOST IMPORTANT DAY HAS ALREADY COME AND GONE! IT LOOKED LIKE THIS:</line>

				<line>Narrator: LITTERING COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: all over the internet</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve tried doing nothing, but that left me feeling like a frustrated milquetoast pushover! I keep wanting to pull the &quot;excuse me, you dropped this&quot; line, but it is sort of an aggressive thing to do, especially if the way I say it makes it clear I think it was, indeed, NO ACCIDENT.  I could see that leading to a confrontation, and I don&apos;t want to be that guy who throws punches over empty cans of Coke!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You could throw down over disgusting used Kleenexes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But it&apos;s an overreaction, isn&apos;t it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I don&apos;t know - littering&apos;s this perfectly situated thing where it&apos;s not THAT big a deal taken individually, but a really antisocial thing when taken on a larger scale.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And yet, not really, when you compare it to, say, murderin&apos; dudes.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Exaclty! I don&apos;t know how I should react when confronted with a small instance of a small crime, but which still bothers me.  All I can think of is to sneak poo bugs into the dude&apos;s food?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: One of the things I&apos;ve imagined, ever since I was a little kid, was how neat it would be if you could sort your life by events and view that instead.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You could see every time you eat delicious sandwiches, organized chronologically!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Wouldn&apos;t that be cool, Dromiceiomimus? I think that would be cool. You could peek ahead and see every time you get into a fight, so you could be prepared!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But you&apos;d be spoiling (in the movie sense) your own life!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: TRUE. But, you&apos;d also be able to see a rapid-fire montage of all the women you ever kiss. That would be neat and hopefully not disappointing!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It would actually be pretty neat, I think! You could see your changing responses and everything.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Here is what I propose: you record yourself whenever you kiss a woman for the first time, and then when you&apos;re old, you edit them all together. A lifetime of work will lead to a memorable result!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It might be awkward getting camera permission JUST before I kiss her. But! I&apos;m up to the task!</line>

				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s fallacy: PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM</line>
				<line>Narrator: &quot;the loaded question&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A &quot;loaded question&quot; is when you ask a question that presupposes something unproven!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For instance, Dromiceiomimus, I could ask, &quot;Hey, Dromiceiomimus! Are you still punching children?&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What? No!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aha - so when did you stop? See what I did there? The question presupposes that you&apos;ve been punching on children in the past, and goes on to suggest that maybe you&apos;re still doing so.  It is LOADED like rich uncle Pennybags.  From Monopoly?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Your question is really two questions combined into one!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It breaks down to &quot;Have you ever punched children, and, if so, are you still doing so?&quot; But since these are merged, and since this merged form still demands a yes or no answer, &quot;no&quot; becomes misleading.  The solution is not to answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, but to reject the question!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Really!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: T-Rex, are you still punchin&apos; children? Are you still punching them just to steal their ice cream cones?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I reject your question, Utahraptor! It&apos;s loaded!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, here&apos;s a COMPELLING IDEA for ending complacency. We&apos;ll insult each other and then become enemies, and THEN, I wouldn&apos;t have our little chats to look forward to anymore. Result: complacency: nullified!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;ve been systematically destroying the life I knew, but that&apos;s just left me panicky and unsatisfied. My romance for something new has led to a realization that I had a routine because I liked what I was doing and when I was doing it.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Time to reclaim your life of only a few hours ago!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes! I will apologize to Dromiceiomimus! And if I ever get too comfortable again, well, I could probably get used to the smothering kiss of complacency. And maybe, one day, I&apos;ll finally be ready to START KISSING BACK.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The answer: me!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: When I was a kid it was okay, because I didn&apos;t have any cultural context and didn&apos;t understand that maybe companies WANTED me to spread the word about their ads. But now that I&apos;m a grown-up target market dude, I know that companies sometimes design ads with the express intent that I&apos;ll get excited and tell my friends!

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: THE UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO TOAST:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So yeah, as I was saying, the relativist fallacy is when you reject a claim by saying &quot;Oh, that may be true for you, but it&apos;s not true for me.&quot;</line>
				<line>God: HUH</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So if I say &quot;the atomic mass of xenon is 131.3 AMU&quot;, a response of &quot;Oh, maybe it is for YOU!&quot; is a fallacy.  But if I said &quot;toast is the ultimate breakfast-time treat&quot;, you could very well respond with &quot;maybe for YOU, not for ME&quot; and it wouldn&apos;t be a fallacy, because as we know the debate over breakfast is as subjective as it is eternal.</line>
				<line> </line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Who are you explaining the relativist fallacy to?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, just God!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: He was asking me what the weight of xenon was and I was all &quot;Duh, 131.3 AMU&quot; and he was all &quot;Duh, maybe for you, T-Rex&quot; and I was all, &quot;Aha! Time to pontificate!&quot; Then I worked in an example about toast.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: This also applies to animation!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The idea is that crudely-realized characters don&apos;t look like real people, but we can see some qualities of real people in them, so they&apos;re cute! But as you add more and more realism without quite reaching perfection, you reach a point where suddenly instead of cartoons that look real, they&apos;re real people who look TERRIBLY WRONG. Cuteness is replaced with the same reaction we&apos;d have to putrid, retching, animated corpse: revulsion, and question is &quot;Why??&quot;.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: This is because women have larger more flared hips than men do, on account of secondary sexual characteristics! So all heterosexual men cannot help but find women&apos;s hips UTTERLY FASCINATING, and all heterosexual women find men&apos;s hips FLABBERGASTINGLY EROTIC.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: I&apos;ve never really been that into hips, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Perhaps that is because you have a case of the perversions!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The second way is to draw attention to your skull!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You mean face?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope, skull! Men have heavier skulls than women, so again, men find light skulls unbelievably sexy, and women find heavy skulls ASTONISHINGLY GORGEOUS.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hah! I&apos;ll bet you five dollars we can&apos;t find even one porn site that&apos;s about heavy and light skulls.</line>
				<line>Narrator: BUT SOON, HILARIOUS CONSEQUENCES!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor! Searching for internet fetish pornography has robbed me of any erotic desires I may have once had!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Me too!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor and T-Rex: Let&apos;s never look at our bodies again!!</line>

				<line>Narrator: HOW TO PASS THE TURING TEST</line>
				<line>Narrator: a helpful comic for machine intelligences that &quot;just have trouble in test situations&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The Turing test is a test that all emergent intelligences face at one point or another!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In it, you have a REAL person engaged in a text conversation with both a person and a machine, and that person has to determine which responder is which. If the machine can appear more &quot;alive&quot; than the person, then they pass!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: And then they&apos;re officially conscious?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope! The problem is that the test doesn&apos;t prove consciousness, just communication, and um, it can be faked.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Oh man - you&apos;re going to say &quot;brute force&quot;! You&apos;re going to use the brute force approach!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hells yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Since conversations don&apos;t last forever, then there&apos;s a finite number of sentences that make sense and that are at least passibly grammatical, so you can just record every possible response to every possible word combination, and kapow! Responses like a real person.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Man! That&apos;s lame.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What&apos;s lame? We&apos;ve just totally faked out the Turing test and all it required was near infinite storage space! Brute force: the approach of kings and the king of approaches?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s neat! You could cheat and have 1920s title cards (&quot;DUDES, FORSOOTH! I&apos;M SO DEAD&quot;) but just silent images would also be cool. What would you have?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: A kid in a tree, and then the tree becomes enormous, and the kid is happy about that.</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Lame! </line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay! Let me think...</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Denied!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: TODAY is the day we talk about meritocracy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In a meritocracy all jobs, including government jobs, are assigned based on MERIT.  So if you&apos;re the best at a job then it&apos;s yours, regardless of your sex or gender or race or stupid mustachio or anything!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But what if I&apos;m awesome at set design while also truly despising all aspects of set design?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, the only problem is there&apos;s absolutely no way to accurately judge merit!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure there is!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: No way dude!  You&apos;d have to know the exact skills AND future potential of EVERYONE.  If you had some omniscient and impartial third party then MAYBE, but you&apos;ll never get rid of cronyism when you have regular dudes trying to determine who&apos;s best.  There&apos;s too much potential for authoritarianism and corruption!</line>

				<line>Devil: MMM SALUTATIONS T-REX</line>
				<line>Devil: HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE MALE GAZE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I have, actually! It&apos;s a film theory.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The idea is that the camera is situated by and for men!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Thus, we always see more of the woman&apos;s body than we do of the man&apos;s in film - the camera possesses the (heterosexual) male gaze, and thereby disenfranchises the woman by reducing her to the passive object of gaze, while the male is elevated to the active gazer. It is a NOT UNCONTROVERSIAL theory.</line>
				<line>Devil: YES BUT</line>
				<line>T-Rex: - but what about that as applied to video games?</line>
				<line>Devil: UM</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Wow, I never thought YOU&apos;D be interested in this male gazey stuff!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Who&apos;d be interested?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: The Devil! I thought he was more interested in, you know, WALL HAXX than in sexual power structures societally encoded into the cinematic gaze! (The added wrinkle of increased agency in games makes it EXTRA interesting!)</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Huh! I guess he surprised you!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Determinism is the idea that every event and thought ever is predetermined! This determination is NOT done by fate or God or whatever, but rather by an almost endless chain of prior events. Causality is king!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Also: there&apos;s also no such thing as a random event!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A nice benefit of this is that free will is reduced to a complete illusion, since everything anyone ever does is already decided. On the plus side, this means that you can decide to do anything you want, because you&apos;re not responsible for it! But on the minus side, it means that you can&apos;t ever ACTUALLY decide to do anything. Thank, determinism!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But come on, even if free will is an illusion, it&apos;s a convincing one!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: True!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So who cares if everything is predetermined then? If it&apos;s utterly convincing that I have free will, what does it matter if it&apos;s all predetermined? I&apos;m still affecting events in ways I choose.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But you&apos;d just be lying to yourself! You&apos;re affecting events, but not CHOOSING anything.</line>
				<line>Off-panel speaker: So how can I be faulted for that, T-Rex... IF IT WAS ALREADY DETERMINED THAT I&apos;D LIE TO MYSELF?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hooray! You pass determinism.</line>
				<line>T-Rex and off-panel speaker: Now, let&apos;s never talk about it again!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: When you break up with someone, can you still be friends?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sources say, &quot;Yep! SURE CAN!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think it&apos;s a good idea because you loved them, right? I don&apos;t see that changing just because you broke up. They still must be pretty great!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But - what if you broke up with them because you didn&apos;t love them anymore?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: OKAY. But there still must be things that attracted you to them, and you can still have those as friends! Maybe they&apos;re really good at karaoke, or adept at shoe repair. That&apos;s attractive!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That IS attractive!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But I think you&apos;re ignoring the possibility that even just seeing this person could be too painful, shoe repair aside. That happens pretty often!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: OKAY HONESTLY I did not expect this to be this complicated. All my breakups have been clean AND totally awesome!</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: How is that a selling point? If we were to put on a Batman play, we&apos;d probably all want to play Batman. That is the essential folly of the Batman play.</line>

		<title>executive summary: t-rex is worried about his own prejudices, but then a jerky guy insults him and he feels better about it?</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: So there&apos;s this guy I know, and he must be a friend of a friend because I see him sometimes at parties, but WE can never be friends because I find looking at him intensely frustrating.  He has the world&apos;s most punchable face!</line>
				<line>Narrator: T-REX AND THE GUY WITH THE WORLD&apos;S MOST PUNCHABLE FACE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And it&apos;s terrible! It reflects poorly on me, I know, but there&apos;s just something about him that is BAD for me.  It&apos;s like being sexually attracted in reverse? I just end up avoiding the guy.  He&apos;s got a stupid face for jerks!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: *sigh*</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I guess I just can&apos;t get past my prejudice against people with stupid faces for jerks.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Oh man, I knew a guy like that!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Really?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah! We went to the same school.  He&apos;s the only guy I&apos;ve ever felt that way about!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I know! It&apos;s the same with me.  MY ONLY CONSOLATION is that somebody else probably thinks I, T-Rex, have a stupid face, so at least I&apos;ll get my prejudice from both sides.</line>
				<line>Narrator: A FEW WEEKS LATER:</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Hey you! You&apos;ve got a stupid face! I - I want to punch it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This somehow validates my own prejudice, mysterious stranger across the street!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Cha-ching! It&apos;s great, because everyone loves Shakespeare AND ALSO finding out what characters were up to before they got interesting. It&apos;ll be Hamlet, only he&apos;s happy and well-adjusted, walking around saying &quot;I certainly hope my father doesn&apos;t get murdered! InDEED!&quot; and then Ophelia says &quot;That&apos;s right, baby! I, incidentally, plan to remain sane.&quot; and then there&apos;s IRONY. Shakespeare fans love irony!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So it&apos;s just Hamlet?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No way dude!</line>

The first year, at breakfast, the first monk speaks and says &quot;I hate oatmeal.&quot;  A year later, again at breakfast, the second monk speaks and says &quot;I love oatmeal.&quot;  Finally, one year later, the last monk gets to speak and HE says &quot;I&apos;m tired of this constant bickering about oatmeal!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hee hee!  Comedy gold!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Aw, that&apos;s an old joke!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: BUT A GOOD ONE!  It&apos;s funny, I think, because the conversation is spread over three years, and NORMALLY, you&apos;d expect monks not to talk about oatmeal for that long.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think it&apos;s funny because monks are normally thought of as holy, not as oatmeal obsessed OR oatmeal loathing!</line>
				<line>God: I THINK IT&apos;S FUNNY BECAUSE IT&apos;S BASED ON A TRUE STORY</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Is it?</line>

		<title>A Modest Proposal: For Preventing Vandals the World Over from Being a Hilarious Burden to Wikipedia and Its Readers, and for Making Them Move Beneficial to the Stern, Encyclopaedia-Reading, Publick</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: The Problem with Wikipedia is that it&apos;s peppered with vandalism at various times and at various locations: vandalism that remains until it&apos;s noticed by someone who knows enough and cares enough to fix it!  SOMETIMES THIS CAN TAKE A WHILE. BUT!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: *ahem*</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ladies and gentlemen: I have solved the Wikipedia Problem!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The solution is as brilliant as it is awesome: instead of vandalizing the ENTIRE encyclopedia, we all just agree to vandalize one article, leaving the other ones alone! That article is the one about chickens. Why? It&apos;s pretty obvious. DUDES ALREADY KNOW ABOUT CHICKENS.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In conceding that one TINY article to the vandals, Wikipedia wins! Their victory: a FULLY ACCURATE encyclopedia that covers every topic in the universe, &apos;cept chickens.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: T-Rex, this is worse than taking on the mob! Wikipedia will be HELLUVA mad at you!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No way! I am doing them a FAVOUR.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Their vandalism problem GOES AWAY, FOREVER, and all that I ask is that chickens become The Forbidden Topic.  &quot;We never talk about chickens&quot;, they can say. &quot;DON&apos;T ASK.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: But how are you going to get people to respect this idea? Plus, IS IT NOT TRUE THAT MANY WIKIPEDIA EDITORS ARE TRULY HUMOURLESS ABOUT WIKIPEDIA??</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I guess we&apos;re about to find out! I bet Fictitional Jimbo Wales loves the idea.</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Something people like to argue about sometimes is whether or not certain things are genetically innate, or personal decisions!</line>
				<line>Narrator: NATURE VERSUS NURTURE</line>
				<line>Narrator: in comic form, baby</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If it&apos;s natural, then you can&apos;t really blame a person for having it, because they didn&apos;t have a choice.  But if it&apos;s because of nurture, then you CAN blame them for it, or the very least their parents!  OR SOCIETY.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Is the whole nature/nurture debate really about assigning blame?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I think so!  It doesn&apos;t change the &quot;nature&quot; (oh ho ho!) of what&apos;s being discussed, just its origin.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well, it&apos;s not just about blame or credit, T-Rex, it&apos;s also about free will!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Free will?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, because if something important about you is fully determined by your genes, then you never had any control over that, and you&apos;re not responsible.  You didn&apos;t have a choice.  On the other hand, if you think babies are born as blank slates, then that&apos;s limitless personal freedom, but that has problems too!</line>
				<line>God: GUYS THERE IS A THIRD OPTION</line>

		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Literally hours of work have paid off, and I have come up with my greatest invention yet...a DUPLICATOR RAY!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: (Duplicator rays let you make perfect copies of anything!)</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Really?  So if I have, say, a papier-m?ch? pi?ata dog filled with tasty candies, your duplicator ray will make a PERFECT duplicate?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!  The duplicate is identical in every regard.  The ray examines the object at the quantum AND subquantum levels and thanks to the twin fists of Actual Science and Heisenberg Compensators, makes a perfect copy, indistinguishable from the original!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I call baloney, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aha! On account of how it violates conservation of energy laws?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Nope, on account of how it&apos;s truly impossible to have a perfect copy of anything!  Philosophically: if I paint a picture and you duplicate it, I&apos;ll grant that they can be identical in every way BUT ONE: mine is the original.  That&apos;s a property that doesn&apos;t have a physical realization, so you can&apos;t ever duplicate it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Okay YEAH it&apos;s not original, but it&apos;s an OTHERWISE PERFECT DUPLICATE.  I can destroy economies based on scarcity and generate clean drinking water for everyone!  I can even DUPLICATE DUDES!  I can&apos;t believe you&apos;re not more excited.  I CAN DUPLICATE BRENT SPINER</line>

		<title>it&apos;s called a negative income tax because instead of bottoming out at you owing the government $0, it can become negative, so the government can owe you money.  that&apos;s right!  taxes, bitches!</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: A negative income tax, or &quot;NIT&quot;, is when the government pays you money when your income is low! Pretty sweet!</line>
				<line>Narrator: NEGATIVE INCOME TAX COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: it will be interesting I PROMISE</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But there is a catch. You still pay taxes - say, a flat tax of 10% - BUT, the government also pays you enough to survive! This way there&apos;s a guaranteed minimum income - like welfare, but simpler. So if you make only $1000 in a year you&apos;ll pay $100 in taxes, but since the government pays everyone, say, $10000, you&apos;ll end up $9900 ahead in tax money. As you make more money, you net less from the government, until you end up actually paying taxes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So this acts to replace welfare?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep! And a bunch of related programs.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It simplifies things, plus it includes a flat tax, which a lot of amateur economists AS WELL AS even some real economists like!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I can see fraud being a problem, though, especially since if the fraud&apos;s successful, the government loses real money.</line>
				<line>Narrator: LATER:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor! I just found out that Milton Friedman, proposer of the NIT, died yesterday at age 94!</line>

What I want is unambiguous, non metaphorical step-by-step instructions!  Buddha is supposed to be a dude who took steps to move from unenlightened to enlightened, right?

				<line>T-Rex: That doesn&apos;t matter!</line>
				<line>T-Rex:: Write down in detail the precise steps each person took and let me generalize across the set.  I want an algorithm for enlightenment!  A checklist for nirvana!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Yes please!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Indeed!  Also, this car appears to be recently driven, causing the snow on it to blow away.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It has been unseasonably warm SINCE the snow, as well!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is true!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That explains why we&apos;re all not wearing snowsuits, and it&apos;s too bad, because we&apos;d look adorable.  Can you imagine?</line>

I&apos;m also pointing to my ear and saying &quot;here&quot;, so there&apos;s level two (a visual pun!) and level THREE is how &quot;here&quot; sounds like &quot;hear&quot; and you can use ears to hear things.  I&apos;ll play it by &quot;hear&quot;, i.e., by how I hear it!  It is a PERFECT STORM of wordplay, Dromiceiomimus!  They make movies out of perfect storms.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Not Hardly! Telegrams were better because they made you go to the door to get them, which meant folks knew you were popular AND getting an important message. Plus they charged by the word so people were concise! Also I think you had to write &quot;STOP&quot; instead of a period so the messages were rad, stop.</line>

And talk to any archaeologist and they&apos;ll complain about sites that have been damaged or destroyed by under-informed Victorian archaeologists that didn&apos;t have the knowledge and skills we have today. Doesn&apos;t it stand to reason that in 100 years we&apos;ll be making the same complaints about today&apos;s work? We only have so much history. Shouldn&apos;t we wait until we&apos;ve perfected archaeology before we dig?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Yes! I have actually done some research this time. Schwing!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Archaeologists ARE aware that they&apos;re mining a finite resource, and when possible, they only dig a little and leave some for the future. But there are time limits: often they&apos;ll be examining a site just before it&apos;s dug up for a new building of something, which means this is their last chance to see what&apos;s there before it&apos;s destroyed. And sometimes the ground is volatile enough that if they don&apos;t dig soon, whatever&apos;s there will be lost anyway!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Isn&apos;t it neat that we have this distinction in English between fewer and elss, but the opposite, &quot;more&quot;, covers both those cases? Our language is ASYMMETRICAL.

				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s disease:</line>
				<line>Narrator: Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or &quot;FOP&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: FOP is one of the rarest conditions known to medicine!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s a genetic disorder that causes muscles and connective tissue to literally change to bone.  As more and more tissue becomes bone, joints become fused and the inflicted person is eventually left ossified and completely unable to move!  Attempts to remove the extra bone simply result in further bone growth.  It is a very painful disease and there is no cure, BUT, the gene that causes it has recently been found, which gives us hope!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Should we be talking about it like this?  Isn&apos;t that a little - crass?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Not really!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We&apos;re spreading AWARENESS of the condition, which is a good thing!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, but it&apos;s such a sensational disease!  Maybe we should - I don&apos;t know, try to be less sensational about it.  We shouldn&apos;t be making jokes.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: So, Dromiceiomimus: Do you know how to draw superheroes? I&apos;ve got such a great idea for a comic.</line>
				<line>Narrator: (IN THIS PANEL, DROMICEIOMIMUS SAYS YES)</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sweet! Okay, so the idea is, there&apos;s this guy, Lee, right? One day he gains SUPER POWERS. And I&apos;m not sure how he gets them yet but BASICALLY he&apos;s got this slot in the top of his head, and he can write words on cards and put them in the slot, so he gains those qualities! So say a decision has to be made: he writes &quot;decisive&quot; on a card and forces it into his head, and he becomes DECISIVE LEE! He then has the power to do things decisively, SUPER decisively!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So he&apos;s got any power that can be described by an English adverb ending in &quot;ly&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: PRECISELY!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But not just Precise Lee, he can be Compelling Lee, Obliging Lee - even Furious Lee! But the catch is, the cards stick out, so enemies know what they&apos;re dealing with. &quot;Oh cool, we&apos;re dealing with Conclusive Lee&quot;, they&apos;ll say. &quot;We can ask him some questions.&quot;</line>

And I don&apos;t want to be the guy that goes around kicking other people&apos;s sandcastles.  Even if they thank me afterwards!  Faith is something rare, at least for me, and I&apos;d hate to take it away from someone else.</line>

			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Today is the day. Yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Today is the day I lose my fear of ZOMBIES. </line>
				<line>Narrator: T-REX AND THE LIVING DEAD</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The way I see it, zombies are either avoidable or too effective. The only way to become a zombie is to be bitten by one, but not to get eaten, yes? Then the bite kills you and you come back as a zombie. But zombies WANT to eat you! It&apos;s only the sucky ones that bite you and don&apos;t finish the job. So if the first zombie was REALLY GOOD, the infection wouldn&apos;t spread, because he&apos;d cold eat all his victims! And if he was sucky you could just avoid him, on account of his suckiness.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: PROBLEM: SOLVED.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re coming from a medical perspective, right?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: The idea is that there&apos;s not too many diseases that can spread easily AND kill you overnight, because they&apos;re too effective: the infection wouldn&apos;t spread, and the disease dies.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes! Zombies are too effective to be contagious. That&apos;s why they can&apos;t exist in real life!</line>

		<title>another comic in which t-rex&apos;s tail gets a line</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I have discovered the ultimate secret to comedy! The more obscure a joke is, the less people there are who&apos;ll get it, but the MORE they&apos;ll find it correspondingly HILARIOUS! I suspect this law progresses geometrically.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: For example!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Let&apos;s say I have a joke about how cats like to sleep. NOT FUNNY, right Dromiceiomimus? Everyone who&apos;s met a sleepy ol&apos; cat can get that. But if I have a joke about how, say, an obscure programming language is pretty wacky, then people who know that language will feel like I&apos;m talking to them! They laugh both at the joke AND in recognition. Comedy increases, and the only reasonable conclusion is &quot;laughs ahoy!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So logically, ALL I HAVE TO DO is find a really rich guy and tell him a joke only HE&apos;D find funny, and I&apos;m set for life!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Huh?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Dude, rich people LOVE to give people money when they make them laugh! And I&apos;m going to track down Patrick Stewart and make him laugh SO HARD. You don&apos;t even know.</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But T-Rex - photons don&apos;t have any mass, do they?  If they had mass, wouldn&apos;t that mean that walking outside on a sunny day would mean being hit with trillions of tiny bullets, reducing everything to a red, pulpy, well-lit paste?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s neat how most of our key verbs are just one syllable long! I think that verbs we use a lot change to short words with time, since if they did NOT, it would take a real long time to say all the run-of-the-mill thoughts we have!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: We&apos;d get bored each time we&apos;d try to talk!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sex! Love! Hate! BONE. All are rad AND short verbs! I bet you could use just short WORDS and find it to be not that hard of a trick!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: You might end up with an odd phrase or two, though, since you&apos;d have to steer clear of all &apos;ing&apos; verbs.</line>

I came up with it when I chemically and accidentally created just a little inspiration, and when I drank that, I was inspired to create more! There&apos;s a whole pool full of it back at my house. You can drown in it.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So what&apos;s in it, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: SECRETS! And chemicals. A mix of both, I guess.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I&apos;m just a LITTLE hesitant to drink something you mixed up at home, especially when you don&apos;t know anything about chemistry.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Whatever, dude! I know enough to come up with ingestible inspiration! It tastes like SUCCESS.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s good times, if you&apos;re not in a car!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But what about important vehicles, like ambulances and so on?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Nanites are tiny robots!  They&apos;re SO TINY that they can robotically mess with things at the molecular level.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Pretty darned sweet, my friends!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The dream is that you could pour a vial of nanites on your bed and they&apos;d transform it at the &quot;nano&quot; level into a better bed, or a big ol&apos; pile of tasty burgers!  You could eliminate hunger, dispose of waste, and so on.  The only downside is that the nanites could malfunction, reproduce without check, and reduce all life to a featureless grey goo.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Or to burgers.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: OR to burgers.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I thought there were issues with the &quot;grey goo&quot; scenario being impossible?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I AM probably confusing science fiction nanites with real nanites.  But one thing we can all agree on is that nanites are pretty neat.</line>

				<line>Narrator: THE STORY OF GEORGE MALLORY AND ANDREW IRVINE (INCREDIBLE TRUE PART)</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Their last sighting was just a few hundred metres from the summit.  They never made it back!  A STANDARD MOUNTAINEERING TALE, except that if they had made it to the top, they&apos;d have been the first, AND they were carrying cameras.  If we could find the frozen cameras we could still retrieve images from them today, and then we&apos;d know if they actually did make it to the top, since who climbs Mount Everest and doesn&apos;t take a picture?  NOBODY, that&apos;s who.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Didn&apos;t other climbers find the bodies?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Only one!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Mallory&apos;s body was found 75 years later, but no cameras were on him.  Irvine&apos;s body is still up there somewhere, maybe with the cameras!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Wow.  There&apos;s something so spooky and sad about their bodies being frozen like that.  It&apos;s like a treasure hunt with a perfectly preserved corpse at the end.</line>
				<line>Narrator: WILD SPECULATION PART:</line>
				<line>Speculation Text: Could all &quot;mountaineering accidents&quot; be the handiwork of a lone, crazed murderer, loose about the peak?  IT COULD BE TRUE!!  If so, no-one has survived their encounter with the pushy &quot;Everest Eliminator&quot; and lived to tell the tale.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: They sure do. We&apos;re going STRAIGHT TO THE TOP, baby! We&apos;ll see if the deadly Everest Eliminator exists or not. SOME claim he&apos;s a wacky murderer who pushes people off the peak when they&apos;re least expecting it! Others say that&apos;s stupid.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s not why we&apos;re going!</line>

		<title>HOW TO GET MARRIED in case you were, um, browsing internet comics and wondering</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>Narrator: HOW TO GET MARRIED</line>
				<line>Narrator: a comic for people who are way into getting married</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you want to get married then first you need to find a mate! You need to find a LIFE PARTNER.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Once you have that partner, then ALL YOU HAVE TO DO is commit to them for the rest of your life, and they to you! It&apos;s really that easy! It&apos;s like buying a Game Boy, opening it up, and then saying, &quot;Yes, this is enough. I will never get tired of Tetris.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ALSO, the Game Boy loves you back.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aaand you&apos;re not allowed to loan the Game Boy out to friends unless you and the Game Boy talk about it first.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I really don&apos;t see why you&apos;re forcing a Game Boy into this, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Utahraptor! It&apos;s an analogy.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, but it&apos;s ridiculous! This is you: &quot;Marriage is like Game Boys, only you marry the Game Boys.&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes, that is a fair and accurate impression of me and my awesome desription of marriage.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But don&apos;t you see? By casting marriage in terms of Game Boys, I make it seem accessible, fun, affordable, and sexy!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Game Boys are like 15 years old!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: THEY ARE 18 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR FOR YOUR INFORMATION</line>
				<line>T-Rex: ALSO WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SAY</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I was going to write a science fiction story, but then I stopped.  I realized I don&apos;t know what science fiction, as a genre, means!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Seriously!  I had some DOUBTS.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If I was writing a western I could go on and on about order versus freedom, civilization versus the wilderness, the hero as a man stuck between these two worlds, and so on!  But what&apos;s science fiction about?  Is it just literature with space ships and robots and casually inverted flux variance?  Aliens stopped being parallels for The Other long ago, didn&apos;t they?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Why are you worried about this, T-Rex?  It&apos;s just a genre label!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So - it&apos;s something that&apos;s applied to your work after it&apos;s completed.  Unless you want to write specifically to a generic form, you don&apos;t have to worry about it!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: My other problem is I don&apos;t have a plotline either.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Man!  Why not write a story about a cat then.  You like cats.</line>

				<line>God: YOU&apos;RE NOT LISTENING T-REX I DON&apos;T WANT TO SEE YOU RUINED DUE TO HILARIOUSLY SUCKY POKER PLAYING</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah but, you can lose at lotteries because it&apos;s just chance, right? But in poker, you can bluff! IN THEORY, I can bluff my way into the annals of poker history AND the annals of &quot;neighbours with suspicious amounts of disposable income&quot;, ALL AT THE SAME TIME. All I need is a good poker face!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: And, you know, skills at poker!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What? I&apos;ve got mad skills at poker!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I believe, canonically, the minimum skill set is knowing when to hold them, as well as being aware of the proper time at which to fold them.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That is advice for people WITHOUT the ultimate poker face. Check this out.</line>

		<title>this comic was gonna have more mistakes in it, but then it was really depressing.  HOW BOUT THOSE ERRORS WE MAKE IN OUR OWN LIVES HUH</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I guess I&apos;ve been pretty lucky to get this far without making any big, life-altering mistakes. I think the biggest mistake I ever made was mixing up some juice from concentrate that had a ladybug in it!</line>
				<line>Narrator: MISTAKE COMICS</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Eww! How did that ever happen!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I was experimenting with mixing juice with a blender, and I guess there was a ladybug in the blender? ALL I KNOW is that when the blender turned off and the smoke cleared, my hitherto delicious juice had clearly-identifiable ladybug pieces floating on top. I recall saying &quot;Aw man! My JUICE!&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So - did you drink the juice!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: No! Of course not!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But that&apos;s not what I wanted to talk about. I wanted to talk about how one bad decision can totally change your life, you know? Lost limbs, broken friendships, unexpected pregnancies with someone you don&apos;t really like: stuff like that.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I woulda thought you&apos;d drink the juice.</line>
				<line>I THINK WE&apos;D ALL RATHER HEAR ABOUT THE BUG JUICE T-REX</line>

		<title>friends and neighbours, yes, i hypothesize a universe in which superman is real and dinosaurs didn&apos;t die out.  IT MAY WELL BE THE GREATEST UNIVERSE EVER</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: The essential problem with Superman, as a character, is that he&apos;s too powerful and incorruptible.  He&apos;s a walking deus ex machina! You give him a foe he can&apos;t beat, and all he has to do is TRY HARDER, and then he beats the guy.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: What I&apos;m saying is that this is not truly satisfying!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The way to make Supes interesting is to put him up against a problem that he can&apos;t fix by punching someone through a building! Put him in a situation where, say, everyone he loves starts dying of a disease that he can&apos;t detect or cure, passing away in his arms, one by one.  At the end he&apos;s left as the sole survivor of the doomed planet Earth, six billion dead - only this time, he had a chance to stop the disaster, and he FAILED.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s a terrible story, T-Rex!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s modern, AND dark!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah, and it destroys the character! Superman is a symbol of hope, and you have him basically standing up and shouting &quot;HOPE IS USELESS AGAINST A SUPERIOR FOE&quot; and then everyone Earth dies.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I bet if Superman were real he&apos;d like my story. He&apos;d say to me, &quot;That was a SUPER interesting story, T-Rex!&quot;</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE SUPERMAN IS REAL!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Superman! If I jump off this building will you save me?</line>
				<line>Superman: Don&apos;t jump off that building!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Will you save me though?</line>

				<line>T-rex: This is because total honesty has the power to DESTROY relationships! FOR EXAMPLE, Dromiceiomimus, if we&apos;re in a committed monogamous relationship, I don&apos;t want my friend or even a random dude coming up to you and saying how he loves you more than anything and how he could never admit it until now! I want him to suffer in silence. For the greater good!</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: T-Rex, you&apos;re my friend and I respect you, but you&apos;re not really ROMANTIC. Romance requires emotional swagger and sensitivity, but you&apos;ve inured yourself to all but the most amusing of feelings, you know? You just attract through other means.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: I feel a profound disconnect with this holiday!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I get that it&apos;s celebrating the UNIVERSAL CONSTANT PI, and that it&apos;s celebrated today because 3.14159 can be translated into Mach 14th, 1:59. But what makes pi so special? Why don&apos;t we celebrate Euler&apos;s Number day on... February 71st?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Some people celebrate &quot;Pi Approximation Day&quot; on July 22nd, which is 22/7.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Hah! Now THAT is a holiday I can get behind!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What? You&apos;re all down on Pi Day but you can get behind an approximation of it?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure can, dude!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s a holiday for people who are GOOD ENOUGH, just not transcendental! They do their best! They get by alright in most situations - just don&apos;t try to build a bridge with them, you know?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It celebrates failure?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Not failure, Utahraptor! Approximations of success!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: On July 22 instead of eating pie, I&apos;m just going to sort of rub pie around my face and call it a day!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Good luck with that.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: (It was seriously awesome!)</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And time was it was a necessary feature of every great movie - just like car chases are today!  You could go into a theatre and be GUARANTEED the slap across the face / smooch on the lips combo, SOMETIMES even before the opening credits were over.  It was good times!  I like the car chases, of course, but I miss the nuance of the old topos.  Great actors would bring such subtlety to the face slap - such pathos to the ensuing makeouts!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I missed the &quot;car chases are necessary in every great movie today&quot; memo!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Necessary AND sufficient!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And like I said, they&apos;re fantastic, but they don&apos;t lend themselves to the smooches.  Today&apos;s actors COULD yell at each other and then make out during a car chase, but they never do.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: When I die, I want to be buried in a bog. I want to become a bog person!</line>
				<line>God: ARE YOU SURE THAT&apos;S A GOOD IDEA</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure am!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The acidic and anaerobic bog water will preserve and tan my soft tissues, while dissolving the calcium in my bones! The end result is that thousands of years later, someone will find my body, still posed as I requested it, just a little floppy because there&apos;s no skeleton holding me up. THIS IS HOW I WANNA SPEND ETERNITY. Also, posed giving a Fonzie-style double thumbs up and holding a sign that says &quot;Dudes, What&apos;s Shakin&apos;.&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Will the sign be preserved?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Probably! If not, we can make it out of soft tissues.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So you want to die and be posed holding a sign MADE OUT OF SKIN, and all the sign says is &quot;Dudes, What&apos;s Shakin&apos;&quot; and there&apos;s not even a question mark.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;ll give future historians something to talk about! They will say, &quot;Wow! Who was this incredible man?&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Anachronism is when you have technology being used before it was invented!  It happens whenever Shakespeare listens to his MP3s.</line>
				<line>Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique: ANACHRONISM</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ah, anachronism!  It can also happen by accident, like when an author forgets that people didn&apos;t write with ballpoint pens 100 years ago or that elves didn&apos;t have friggin&apos; computers.  Sometimes if it&apos;s a really obvious error it can be played for comedy.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It is an advanced literary technique used by only our most handsome authors!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So when someone has a time machine, is that anachronism?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Unfortunately, no!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Time machines are a special case.  If there is a time machine in the story then a lot of anachronism can be explained by the time machine, and is thus NO LONGER ANACHRONISM.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I like that this is the one literary technique that has allowances for time travel.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah.  It&apos;s the best.</line>

		<title>if the house or car were speaking in panel three, then one could reasonably argue that there was some anthropomorphism occuring in Dinosaur Comics</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Anthropomorphism is when you have things that normally can&apos;t talk walking around and behaving like people!  It happens whenever a toaster flips you off.</line>
				<line>Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique: ANTHROPOMORPHISM</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Anthropomorphism is often used in childrens&apos; stories where you have talking animals, but can also be used in more adult works!  This is because occasionally adults enjoy it when a cat is sassy.  Sometimes, a character will be anthropomorphized by mistake, like when you write a play and accidentally attribute dialogue to a ceiling tile.  The ceiling tile is said to be &quot;anthropomorphized&quot; if the oversight is not corrected in a timely fashion.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: We all know what anthropomorphism is, dude!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Aw man, really?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yep! We&apos;ve actually talked about it before, remember?  But - you know, thanks for the reminder!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Well, you&apos;re welcome!  Anytime you need anthropomorphism explained, just drop me a line.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Gotcha.</line>
				<line>Narrative: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>

		<title>understanding ethical relativism</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: I feel that I know what&apos;s best for me, and I have no right to judge your beliefs.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: All beliefs and ethics are &quot;relative&quot;!</line>
				<line>Narrator: UNDERSTANDING ETHICAL RELATIVISM</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I stomp this house because I feel it would be a good idea to do so! Do not judge me, Dromiceiomimus!</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But I believe it is wrong! Which of us is right?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That is the beauty of relativism: we both are!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Ethical relativism is the best philosophy ever!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Oh really?!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: It can be argued that in every rational person (the definition of &apos;rational&apos; is a touchy subject I won&apos;t discuss here) there are certain properties common to all. The problem (well, one problem) with relativism is how it nihilistically privileges the experience of the individual above all else, making every ethical decision the right ethical decision: who would not like to have his or her beliefs guaranteed to be as correct as anybody else&apos;s? But this is done at the cost of ignoring our shared qualities, turning away from the fact that despite different languages and cultures (and continents and skin colours) we all believe some of the same things. With that striking fundamental truth removed, the baby-rapers and the saints stand side by side, equals in righteousness.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But your first assumption is flawed! I doubt you can find even one universal constant; even your revealing example of baby-rape is practiced by some! Granted, these people are considered&quot; monsters&quot;, but isn&apos;t that just a case of the majority condemning a minority? I don&apos;t mean to justify baby-rape, but only to point out that it&apos;s unlikely you can come up with even one belief that is universal!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Allusion is a reference to a person, place, or thing in a piece of literature!  Like when Picard mentions Moby Dick in Star Trek: First Contact?</line>
				<line>Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique:</line>
				<line>Narrator: ALLUSION</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Allusions are pretty handy because they allow you to summarize potentially complex ideas with one succinct reference, essentially piggybacking on the brilliance of previously established works!  HOWEVER, if the audience isn&apos;t familiar with the reference, the alluson fails and can seem weird or out-of-place.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Just like Oliver Brackenbury!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex and Dromiceiomimus: Hah hah hah!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You sure have been summarizing literary techniques a lot lately!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure have!!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Well - what&apos;s going on in your life beyond that?  What&apos;s new?  What&apos;s shakin&apos; with the dude?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: In CONCLUSION, anachronism, anthropomorphism and allusion are the only three literary techniques! There aren&apos;t any others. Okay there were some others but they died.</line>

				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique:</line>
				<line>Narrator: ALL THE REST</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: But what about foreshadowing? Denouement? SYNECDOCHE?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: All dead! Today&apos;s readers yawn in the face of foreshadowing! They wince when seeing ANY events that occur after the climax! They throw up a little when a part is used to represent the whole! You can tell when that&apos;s happened because you&apos;ll go to the library and hear &quot;Synedoche?! bleggh&quot;</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s ridiculous! People use synecdoche all the time.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: People throw up all the time too!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It has been described as the single most important battle in history!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is because had the Greeks lost, then so too would the early idea of democracy been denied its initial flourishing, which could have affected all of western civilization! Seeing how influential western civilization has been on the world, if I am a dude who wants to make WILD UNPREDICTABLE CHANGES to the history of time, this seems like the place and time to do it!</line>

				<line>Narrator: T-REX LOVES OUT-OF-GENRE COVER SONGS</line>
				<line>Narrator: they&apos;re great</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They&apos;re great because say you love a particular hip hop song, but wouldn&apos;t you love it EVEN MORE if it was an opera?  Yes, you would!  Also, wouldn&apos;t you love arias ten times better as gangsta rap songs?  Here again, the answer is yes.  I don&apos;t know why all music is apparently produced originally in the wrong genre as the one nature intended, but I accept it, and thank those artists bold enough to see beyond the limits of generic form!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Isn&apos;t it just the novelty of it that appeals to you though?</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Dudes: that is correct!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I have used my &quot;in&quot; with the ladies to spread around some tips!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I told them that we like birthdays and cool presents and when they are nice.  Now chicks will know what we like!  I know there are some men out there who would have preferred I&apos;d given more SALACIOUS tips, like &quot;how to please man in the milieu of the bed-room&quot;, but that is ridiculous.  Here is how you please a man in the milieu of the bed-room: I DUNNO, MAYBE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WILL DO THE TRICK??</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Man, that&apos;s reverse sexism!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nope, just regular sexism!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Okay but still, it&apos;s spreading the idea that all men care about is sex and that they&apos;re unable or unwilling to distinguish between sex good and bad.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: It&apos;s a joke that plays off gender stereotypes!  Here, I&apos;ll prove it via the scientific method... OF ASKING RANDOM MEN WHAT THEY THINK!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Excuse me!  Male pedestrians?</line>
				<line>Male Pedestrians 1, 2, and 3: What&apos;s up?</line>

				<line>Narrator: THE REVENGE OF T-REX</line>
				<line>T-Rex: All I have to do is put out a major motion picture and include in it a brilliant role for Kelsey. It will be a dazzling, moving role, but will also play to his type as a smart yet sassy older man. It&apos;ll be a role that screams &quot;Kelsey Grammer&quot;: a touchstone that defines a generation - and a career. I&apos;ll even name the character &quot;Kelsey G&quot;! THEN, I&apos;m gonna just go ahead and give it to somebody else. SORRY, KELSEY! TOO BAD FOR YOU THERE, HUH?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: What&apos;d Kelsey ever do to you, T-Rex?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Nothing! He seems like a nice guy!</line>

		<title>as soon as you buy into solipsism you change &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; into &quot;I think, therefore maybe some guy made me up?&quot; and that is LESS CATCHY.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: The opposite of solipsism (where you believe you are the only real person who is imagining a universe) is antisolipsism, in which you believe everyone is real except you! I may have just made this up. Anyway!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You believe you&apos;re totally fake!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: You&apos;re just a sustained figment of everyone else&apos;s imagination. The only issue with THAT is how everyone is imagining the same dude at the same time so well.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Perhaps they&apos;re imagining different things, but whenever anyone imagines you, they also imagine you up a whole universe, history, and consistent sense of self!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Perhaps!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Or perhaps it&apos;s just one person doing the imagining!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you buy into solipsism, then what are the odds you&apos;re the chosen one? Maybe there&apos;s some actual solipsist who really IS the only real thing going, and they&apos;re imagining everything for you, even when you&apos;re not around. What a card, huh? What a crazy dude!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you believe one person can imagine a universe, you have to believe they can imagine your thoughts too, and then you&apos;ve got no reason to believe you&apos;re real!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Let&apos;s go tell a solipsist, and then punch him, and then say &quot;Stop imagining punching yourself!&quot;</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Similar to antisolipsism but ACTUALLY REAL is the Cotard Delusion, in which the person affected believes they have died.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: So it goes!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: The condition was first identified over 100 years ago. This is UNFORTUNATE, because it was identified before the proper nomenclature was in place. It should&apos;ve been called :I Think I Might Be A Zombieitis.&quot;</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: That&apos;s a little disrespectful, plus, that don&apos;t hunger for living flesh.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: &apos;I Think I Might Be A Zombie Who&apos;s Fullitis&quot;.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: That is, I think, even more disrespectful.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: What are the symptoms beyond that?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh, what you&apos;d expect, really.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: A disconnect with life, a sense of emotional and physiological flatness which may be a symptom or a cause of the disorder. It&apos;s very rare, but one that I imagine is quite upsetting for everyone involved. Sometimes the person affected won&apos;t eat. </line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Creepy!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep! This continues a theme in my life of being terrified of all that can go wrong with my brain. Hey, you wanna invent a way  to transform our minds into something non-physical so that we can live safely forever?</line>

		<title>this comic goes out to my stinky sofa. oh, stinky sofa, what am i going to do with you</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Panpsychism is the belief that everything in the universe has consciousness - not just chicks and dudes, but even inorganic matter like steel! Even the stinky ol&apos; sofa that nobody likes because it stinks when you sit on it.</line>
				<line>God: DUDE THROW OUT THE SOFA</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I hear you, man!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Anyway, it doesn&apos;t necessarily claim that drywall spends its time writing poems about, you know, DRYWALL STUFF - it only claims that there are some elements of sentience in everything. When you boil water it might be enjoying it, that&apos;s all. Or, it might be writhing in pain, screaming for mercy with a mouth that now speaks only with a scalding voice of steam.</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Yikes!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Some panpsychists go further than that though!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Oh yeah?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Yeah: at the extreme, you have panpsychists who believe that the entire universe possesses a single mind, and that everything, including us, is a part of it.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I can see the appeal of that! Though you&apos;d kinda have to wonder what the universe is thinking about.</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN THE MIND OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE:</line>
				<line>Universe: I am going to draw a mental picture of all the dudes who need to throw out their sofas. OH LOOK, LOOK! IT&apos;S ONLY ONE DUDE! NOW I&apos;M GONNA IMAGINE HIM SAYING SOMETHING EMBARRASSING</line>

				<line>T-Rex: It turns bad things into a value proposition!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I&apos;m all for optimism and for comforting people, so it&apos;s not TERRIBLE, but I&apos;ve always read the phrase as saying &quot;you&apos;re sad because you got a raw deal, but ACTUALLY things will be better in the future because of this event, so you&apos;re coming out on top!&quot; It seems very - capitalistic, I guess? Like I would want to be comforted by being told that, despite appearances, I&apos;m actually a savvy businessman?</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think the phrase is more to try to find sense to a senseless loss, T-Rex.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I guess.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And I get that it&apos;s meant to comfort, and I respect that! I just don&apos;t like how it implies I&apos;m sad because of a bad deal. I&apos;m sad for the loss, you know?</line>

				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Actually T-Rex, that&apos;s not really true, and plus that&apos;s not really a fair comparison.  Dancing is something you do in response to music!  There are lots of paintings, films and plays that really ARE about your response to them.</line>

		<title>magic realism is where you tell a realistic story but then have the characters turn each other into frogs for a bit.  depressive realism is different.</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Depressive realism is the theory that depressed people have a more accurate view of the world than the non depressed. It started when psychologists experimented with some regular chicks and dudes AND some depressed chicks and dudes.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: That&apos;s how these things always start!!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Anyway, they put them in a room with a button and a lightbulb. The light turned on and off regardless of when the button was pressed, and the participants who were depressed were more likely to conclude that they weren&apos;t in control of the light! The non-depressed people DELUDED THEMSELVES into thinking they had more influence. The popular conclusion was that depressed people saw things more realistically!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: That&apos;s a pretty strong conclusion!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Sure is!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: And it turns out that the effect only shows up in specific trivial situations! But it&apos;s a popular idea. I think some people just like the idea that depression might be an advantage!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: ESPECIALLY depressed people.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: But not TOO much, because then they wouldn&apos;t be depressed anymore!</line>
				<line>Narrator: AT THE PARK:</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Excuse me, sir, you look depressed! Would you say you have a more accurate view of the world?</line>
				<line>Some Dude: I&apos;m not depressed! I&apos;m just eating a sandwich.</line>

				<line>T-Rex: Okay okay - so there&apos;s been a lot of people born, right? In the history of time there are a lot of people who have been born. So the question is, are there enough people in the world that I could write out a story...</line>
				<line>T-Rex:  ... and reasonably expect it to have already been LIVED OUT in real life?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Let&apos;s assume narratives can be reduced to yes/no decisions, and on average real people make a yes/no decision every 15 seconds. Two people are needed to cover each option for every decision! So after - um, 33 decisions, we&apos;ve got more people needed than are alive now, and we&apos;re only eight minutes into our story. It is a stories-in-real-life disaster!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: BUT, if I wrote a story about the first eight minutes of a baby&apos;s life, ODDS ARE someone has lived it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Not really!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re assuming that for each decision, every person takes a separate route, but the vast majority of babies are doing the same thing: crying and then being confused.</line>

		<title>in today&apos;s comic, a dinosaur tells off shakespeare for not agreeing with him about foreshadowing!  now if todd goldman puts that on a t-shirt, you&apos;ll know where he stole it from</title>
		<body>
			<panel>
				<line>T-Rex: Foreshadowing is when you hint at what&apos;s about to happen next in a story! It happens whenever a character announces &quot;BOY I SURE HOPE THERE ARE NO EXPLOSIONS ON THE NEXT PAGE!!&quot; just before he gets blown up!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: In an EXPLOSION!</line>
				<line>Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUES COMICS</line>
				<line>Narrator: today&apos;s technique: FORESHADOWING</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Foreshadowing&apos;s great, because sometimes people want to know what happens in a story before it actually happens. In situations like this, an author might write &quot;Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space. Or WAS she?? You&apos;d better keep reading, huh?&quot; There, foreshadowing both hinted at the future of the story, AND encouraged the reader to keep reading. This is an extremely canonical use of foreshadowing.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So doubt&apos;s important to foreshadowing?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Absolutely!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: If you simply say &quot;Jenn realized that she was about to blast into space! Seconds later, she blasted into space!&quot; that is not foreshadowing. That is just outstanding space storytelling.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: I think it&apos;s still foreshadowing.</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yeah? Well maybe we&apos;ll see what SHAKESPEARE has to say...!</line>
				<line>Narrator: MEANWHILE, IN TUDOR ENGLAND!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Shakespeare, is it still foreshadowing if it&apos;s about a woman who&apos;s DEFINITELY blasting into space?</line>
				<line>Shakespeare: i dunno... yes?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Shakespeare! The correct answer is &quot;no!&quot;</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Pull yourself together, Shakespeare!</line>

				<line>T-Rex: But they also extended beyond art, to food! Futurists had a MANIFESTO for food. It banned the knife and fork and pasta, AND told people that sardines and pineapples together were tasty times! They banned pasta because it caused skepticism?</line>
				<line>Dromiceiomimus: Was the food good?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe? But it wasn&apos;t very popular.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: People were more into the art!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Yep!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: They didn&apos;t want to have to eat their food under UV lamps which &quot;activated&quot; it, nor did they want to give up pasta.  It&apos;s crazy! The movement started in Italy, and I believe people canonically eat pasta there all the time! Like, even for breakfast?</line>

				<line>God: THAT&apos;S YOUR ANSWER TO EVERYTHING T-REX BUT COMICS ARE ALREADY EXCEPTIONALLY AWESOME</line>
				<line>T-Rex: This is true! I guess they still have a stigma attached to them, though, you know? The whole &quot;comics are for emotionally stunted shutins&quot; thing, which, WHILE TRUE, is misleading because comics are for everyone, INCLUDING emotionally stunted shutins! People just need to focus on the positive.</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: So your ad campaign would be &quot;Forget stereotypes: comics are rad!&quot;?</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Maybe!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I was thinking more &quot;You know who reads comics? HORRIBLE MURDERERS.&quot; and then a picture of a horrible murderer, you know, maybe murderin&apos; something, and THEN, in tiny letters, &quot;and also you, hopefully!&quot; and then maybe a line drawing of a soggy dog giving a thumbs up.</line>

Its such a big thing -- you&apos;re sharing your LIFE with someone!  Until you DIE! -- that saying &quot;if it happened it&apos;d be nice, but no worries!&quot; seems - disingenuous?</line>

				<line>Utahraptor: You&apos;re not committing to it either!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: I guess love and the artifacts of affection are so played up in our society that by being noncommittal to its (arguably) greatest expression, marriage, I avoid tacitly endorsing the commercialization of an emotion and the industry surrounding it!</line>
				<line>Utahraptor: Perhaps!</line>
				<line>T-Rex: Or perhaps I don&apos;t want to say &quot;I WANT TO GET MARRIED SOMEDAY&quot; because if I never meet someone then I&apos;ve FAILED at a life plan.
